4648,CS002B Management and Conservation of Aquatic Systems,Abobi,Seth Mensah,mabobi@uds.edu.gh,"Complexity, resilience and fisheries production of man-made lakes in northern Ghana","Man-made lakes are important ecosystems that contribute to food security and livelihoods in many countries. Understanding the food web dynamics and the functioning of these systems is crucial for developing sustainable management strategies. To assess differences in production characteristics, food web structures and resilience, this study addresses three important Ghanaian man-made lakes (Tono, Bontanga and Golinga) through a food web modelling approach (Ecopath with Ecosim). The lakes differ in size and morphology, generating specific conditions for ecosystem functioning and fishing activity. While the two top fishery target species were <em>Sarotherodon galilaeus</em> (L.) and <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em> (L.) in all reservoirs, the mean trophic level of the catch was lowest in the largest and deepest reservoir (Tono) due to higher trophic level species occupying less accessible deep “refuge” habitats. The smallest lake had the highest fish production under optimal conditions of water supply (17.1 compared with 15.5 and 10.1 t/km<sup>2</sup>/year for lakes Bontanga and Tono), but it appears to be most vulnerable under conditions of drought. &nbsp;Bontanga, which has intermediate characteristics (age, surface area, water volume, mean depth, water level fluctuation) and fewer farming activities in the lake’s catchment area depicted the highest level of system maturity and resilience, showing the narrowest ratio of total primary production to total respiration. For the planning and construction of adequately sized reservoirs used for fishery and irrigation purposes, the water budget needs to be estimated.",4,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,
4660,CS002A Management and Conservation of Aquatic Systems,Wigand,Cathleen,wigand.cathleen@epa.gov,Shifting of the Marsh Management Paradigm,"Accelerated sea level rise and an increase in extreme weather events have caused vegetation die-offs and degradation of salt marshes. No longer do natural resource managers only evaluate marsh condition and integrity, but now assess vulnerability to climate change stressors and overall coastal resiliency. Restoration plans now include climate adaptation considerations, which might include redesigning or modifying marshes to increase resiliency to climate change stressors. Marshes provide aesthetic and cultural values as well as ecosystem services that are essential to many communities. A socio-ecological, adaptive management approach allows for setting social and ecological goals, and the iterative monitoring aspect of the approach allows evaluation of reaching or falling short of social and ecological targets. Lessons-learned in a socio-ecological systems approach can inform future climate adaptation actions. Coastal marshes in Rhode Island (USA) were assessed to be vulnerable to accelerated sea level rise, and adaptation actions taken by managers to successfully improve resiliency were sediment placement of dredged sediments to build elevation (Ninigret marsh, RI) and creation of runnels to increase surface drainage (Pettaquamscutt marsh, RI). In earlier decades, the marsh management paradigm entailed assessing condition and integrity and implementing restoration actions to return marshes to an earlier reference state. In the present paradigm, marsh management entails assessing condition and vulnerability and implementing climate adaptation actions to build resiliency.",0,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Portixol 1,

Previous studies have extensively explored the influence of spatial scale on these relationships. However, the effect of temporal scale remains poorly understood. Here, we use paired air-water mean daily and monthly summer temperatures collected over four years from 130 monitoring stations in Japanese mid‑ to low‑order streams to investigate whether perceived effects of different environmental controls on water temperature are dependent on the timescale of the temperature data, and whether those dependencies are related to the spatial scale at which these controls operate. We found a clear pattern for the significant cooling effect, high relative importance and strong dominance exerted by the riparian forest cover on daily temperatures at the reach scale becoming dampened by concomitant increases associated to the proportion of volcanic geology on monthly temperatures at the catchment scale. These results highlight the importance of contextualizing the effects of environmental controls on water temperatures to the timescale of the analysis. Such dependencies are particularly important for the management and conservation of instream thermal habitats in a rapidly warming world.",0,6,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

This scenario poses complex tasks for researchers, managers, and policymakers, which require a well-defined framework to provide a clear roadmap that identifies steps to apply in adaptive management decisions, monitoring designs and policy architecture. Here we present a detailed and comprehensive Multiple Stressors Assessment Framework for aquatic ecosystems that is unique by its unified approach and management integration. It involves seven steps: 1) scope definition, 2) threats and stressors data compilation, 3) selection of endpoints 4) stressor-response relationships, 5) ecological conceptual models, 6) future predictions and model validation, and 7) adaptive monitoring. We review progress made in Europe, the USA and Canada in this field using case examples, highlight the approaches taken by the different jurisdictions that align with our framework and conduct a policy impact analysis for each region. We conclude that there is a disconnection between the investigation of the combined effects of multiple stressors and the implementation of management practices and policy design. The way forward is through a collaborative effort to create standardized methodologies and appropriate programmes in this field. We hope the proposed framework can be used as a foundation to diagnose multiple stressor interactions and identify responses of ecological indicators to inform effective adaptive management of freshwater ecosystems globally.&nbsp;",15,10,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Interpreting recovery is often complicated as ecosystems can experience local forcings alongside regional influences such as climate warming. Paleolimnology, which uses the environmental information preserved in freshwater sediments, can provide the long-term records needed to assess recovery and unravel the confounding influence of multiple stressors. In the historically contaminated St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, ON, long-term data are needed to assess the efficacy of natural recovery in reducing the ecological risk associated with sedimentary contaminants. Despite decades of remedial action, metal(loids) including neurotoxic mercury remain in waterfront sediment in concentrations exceeding provincial severe effect levels. To assess benthic recovery, long-term records of subfossil chironomid (Order: Diptera) assemblages in dated sediment cores were compared among two impacted Cornwall sites and a downstream reference site. Chironomids were functionally absent from the Cornwall sediment records during times of high industrial loading of contaminants. As contaminant concentrations declined, chironomid abundance increased, and the relative abundance of metal-tolerant taxa decreased in favour of warm-water, macrophyte-associated taxa. This suggests that ecological recovery has occurred, and that habitat and temperature are the primary drivers structuring modern-day chironomid assemblages.",5,2,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Because current protocols only measure <em>living</em> organisms there is a need for a generic method to determine viability among mixed assemblages of organisms. A custom mRNA oligonucleotide probe was developed as a close proxy of reproduction for use in evaluations of ballast water management systems (BWMS) used to treat ballast water. The mRNA probe targeted the 16S small sub-unit, ribosomal RNA of the genera <em>Tetraselmis, </em>a phytoflagellate commonly cultured and used in land-based evaluations of BWMS. An RNA extraction protocol was developed, and probe specificity was evaluated by comparison of several targeted and closely related species within the genera. Quantitative PCR demonstrated amplification of <em>Tetraselmis</em> species but low or no amplification of closely related outgroups. Results showed <em>Tetraselmis</em> species template concentrations increased by a factor of 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup>, whereas outgroups showed little or no changes in template concentrations. These results suggest concentrations of viable individuals from representative genera may be used to determine the survivability of organisms broadly, which would align this analytical method with the international requirements for ballast water discharge.",8,12,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The presentation highlights opportunities and challenges faced in automated monitoring of fish abundance, biomass, and behaviour. Automated data extraction using computer vision on robust and inexpensive camera systems is particularly valuable for increasing efficiency and reliability in monitoring that is currently difficult, dangerous, or prohibitively expensive. It can supercharge science. It can improve management – of wild fisheries and aquaculture. Increased automation helps to detect trends in the abundance and biomass of fish and benthic animals. It is also enabling more efficient monitoring of the extent and condition of fish habitat, of the presence of invasive species, and of interactions among species. New analytics are being developed as we move from the traditional scenario of having sample sizes that are often too small to be reliable, to a scenario of having far more data than fits on a hard-drive! So automation is creating new training needs and opportunities. There is a need for new statistical procedures for QA-QC and to avoid embedded pseudo-replication.

While being fundamental for cycling of matter and habitats of highly diverse communities, rivers are of high importance for global biodiversity. However, river networks are amongst the most threatened ecosystems due to anthropogenic mutilation, such as loss of structural or functional connectivity. The meta-ecosystem framework integrates several spatiotemporal scales and components of riverine ecosystems: By incorporating meta-community aspects and food web structures over time, it describes how spatial flows of energy, materials and organisms under distinct environmental conditions, between and within spatial units, determine ecosystem functioning, community composition and biodiversity. The transformation of riverine landscapes into industrialized systems affects connectivity properties by changing the spatial arrangement of landscape characteristics and temporal patterns of exchange processes. Human interventions such as hydraulic engineering or soil sealing result in further changes in connectivity properties at local and regional scales. Thus, connectivity changes occur across all three spatial dimensions and across time in river ecosystems. Here, we review essential properties of hydrological connectivity dimensions in order to explore approaches that can assess connectivity changes and allow for an integration into the meta-ecosystem context and to introduce novel assessment tools, which are useful for understanding structural and functional connectivity.",1,8,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Larval stickiness, which commonly occurs in Pinnids, trap larvae and air bubbles together, limiting swimming behaviour and forcing larvae to float to the water surface. Hence, a new rearing system was designed using the following characteristics: (1) the system included two 500 L round-shaped tanks connected with a pipe; (2) two showers were connected to the top of each tank to cause surface disturbance to help larvae sink back into the water column; (3) aeration was not used; however, oxygen exchange was obtained from (2). In 2018, approximately 1.25 million fertilized eggs of <em>Atrina&nbsp;lischkeana</em>&nbsp;were stocked into each rearing system (N=3). Rearing was halted on day 10 for one system due to high mortality, however, continued until day 65 for the other two systems. Settlement started on day 24, reaching ca 600 micro meter&nbsp;in shell length, with a combined survival rate of 5.05%. Seed production of Pinnids has attracted great attention worldwide though none has been considered consistent.

The influence of a catastrophic flood,"Despite our deepening knowledge on non-perennial streams, they are still poorly recognized and people still perceive them as less valuable and worthy of conservation than perennial streams.&nbsp;In this vein, mass media plays a crucial role due to its power to shape peoples’ opinions and attitudes, so it can contribute to improve people's perceptions towards non-perennial streams.&nbsp;Here, we analysed how non-perennial streams are depicted by mass media in the Balearic Islands. and how a catastrophic flood influenced mass media communication about these ecosystems. We analysed all news reports related to streams, published in the most read newspaper of the Balearic Islands for 25 months (12 months before and after a catastrophic flood). A total of 407 news reports were analysed to identify the topics covered (e.g. floods, ecology, stream uses, water quality). News reports related to non-perennial streams focused on past floods and their consequences, and our analyses showed how the catastrophic flood event marked the news’ temporal agenda, as well as the territorial inequalities in media coverage. News reports rarely covered ecological aspects of non-perennial streams or the relevance of non-perennial streams for freshwater resources. We concluded that mass media contribute to generate a collective memory around flood events but also to the social misconception about non-perennial streams. This talk aims to raise awareness about the need of a fluid communication between researchers and media in order to educate society about non-perennial streams and flood risk.",0,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

This fish has remained at an historically low population status since the 1800s. Although it is illegal to catch wild Atlantic salmon in the United States, their populations continue to need close monitoring and protection. One of the threats to salmon populations is climate change or increasing temperature variations, which is the main focus of my study. Atlantic Salmon are a vulnerable species making it&nbsp;critical to understand what aspects are impacting their populations so that informed decisions can be made to further support restoration efforts. This study used scale samples and data collected from a long term catch, mark &amp; release project where NOAA Fisheries and Maine Department of Marine Resources utilize rotary screw traps. The method innocuously captures smolts so biologist can collect scale samples along with physiological indicators of growth (weight &amp; length). The data covers a 25-year period from the years 1996-2022, not including 2020. This study only includes data gathered from age two smolt scales samples from the Narraguagus River in Maine. Samples from 2022 were aged, imaged, and measured during this study, 30 samples were selected from each year totaling 750. Microscopy was used to view scale samples and determine their ages, then digital images of each were analyzed with Image-Pro. This software program collects numerical data and measurements from different scale features. The data collected are indicators of growth including scale radius, circuli count, distance from radius to each circulus, and distance to each annulus. The resulting data was graphed with the R programming language to visualize trends in fish growth and then compared to annual temperature variations in Maine. The research indicated that climate change represented by increasing annual temperatures may have an impact on smolt growth. The U.S. Atlantic Salmon population is an internationally migrating anadromous species that require multi-organizational corroboration to prevent further depletion. The research considers current changes in annual temperature in Maine as a factor impacting salmon scale patterns. These aging indicators are key determinants for the growth, health, and stability of salmon populations. Therefore, monitoring these changes is an important aspect for supporting restoration efforts of the Atlantic Salmon. By researching Atlantic Salmon smolts from the Narraguagus River, we can determine how the species is thriving in the rivers while closely monitoring the impacts of a changing climate on the species.",3,4,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The proposed approach combines a data-driven outlier detection algorithm with outlier indexing framework to identify and address outliers in coastal ecosystem management. The outlier detection algorithm is based on a combination of statistical methods and environmental management criteria such as heavy metals etc. The outlier index was calculated based on the amplitude, frequency, and scope (number of monitoring parameters detected as outliers) of outliers at each monitoring station and the index scores were ranked to prioritize to management area in a coastal ecosystem. Among the coastal ecosystem monitoring parameters, environmental items such as nutrients and heavy metals were mainly detected as outliers, and high outlier index scores were given to the semi-closed bays and estuaries. Through these series of processes, the management plan can be completed by additionally analyzing the pollution load in high-scored areas. This approach can help establish coastal ecosystem management targets and areas inductively from a large amount of monitoring data.&nbsp;This paper was supported by MOF, KOEM, and KIMST programs, Comprehensive Marine Ecosystem Monitoring Program and&nbsp;Development of AI-based Diagnosis and Prediction Technology for Marine Ecosystem Management.",14,13,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Accordingly, calls for researchers, policy-makers and society to interact more effectively are plentiful. From a science perspective, many marine scientists have the ambition to impact management but often we lack the right training and time to do engage in knowledge exchange. Such engagement also comes with new challenges regarding transdisciplinary collaboration, including different work cultures, timeframes, and disciplinary boundaries. Therefore, we systematically identified case studies of transdisciplinary knowledge exchange and conducted a survey with such researchers who had been engaged in a successful science-policy interaction. Based on those 25 case study experiences, we analysed which approaches to transdisciplinary engagement between marine research and management were used, what outcomes were achieved, what enabled the success of knowledge exchange, and what lessons can be drawn from them to improve KE at the interface of marine science and policy. Results show that a diversity of approaches was used for knowledge exchange. We found that diverse successes at the interface of marine science and policy are achievable. Such successes were enabled by factors related to the actors, processes, support, context, and timing, which we will unfolded in this contribution. Moving forward, we underline the necessity to learn from these ‘bright spots’ to support evidence-informed management and overcome the challenges in transdisciplinary collaboration.",5,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Monitoring the fish species richness and other diversity indices are important indicators of ecosystem condition. Species richness relates to the number of species in an ecosystem. This research will focus on three sites along a salinity continuum in Chesapeake Bay where abundance data for the various species collected will be analyzed. We hypothesize that varying salinity conditions will support different fish species richness at different sampling locations. In addition to species richness, we will explore functional diversity across the Bay to see whether salinity is a variable that exerts important influence from a functional diversity standpoint. Functional diversity helps us tell how the species interact in an ecosystem. We will use GIS and statistical regressions to identify variations in species richness along identified gradients.

Thus, identifying dispersal pathways may reveal key drivers of population dynamics. We are using field surveys, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, and biophysical modeling to improve understanding of natural and anthropogenic factors that facilitate the spread of a non-native foliose bryozoan, <em>Watersipora</em>, among artificial and natural habitats off southern California, USA. <em>Watersipora, </em>which has a short planktonic duration, is widely reported from harbors, piers, and offshore oil platforms, and more recently from natural reefs, including marine protected areas (MPAs), in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC). Previous biophysical modeling of <em>Watersipora</em> has suggested little to modest potential connectivity between artificial and rocky reef habitat in the SBC. Analysis of a set of 7690 segregating SNPs from 18 spatially separated populations revealed little (37% of pairwise Fst comparisons) to moderate (67% of comparisons) differentiation between populations. Genetic similarity between some populations from harbors, platforms, and reefs with low potential connectivity likely reflects assisted dispersal via hull fouling. To date, our data suggest that multiple factors, including the short planktonic duration, oceanographic and human-mediated dispersal, founder effects, and variation in larval source populations contribute to genetic differentiation across sites.",7,11,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Angeler, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Aquatic Sciences and Assessment, Uppsala, Sweden (david.angeler@slu.se) Ran Hur, Uppsala University, Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden Panarchy, a model of dynamic systems change at multiple, interconnected spatiotemporal scales, allows assessing whether management influences ecological processes and resilience. We assessed whether liming, a management action to counteract anthropogenic acidification, influenced scale-specific temporal fluctuation frequencies of ecological communities&nbsp;in lakes. We also tested whether these fluctuations correlated with proxies of liming (Ca:Mg ratios) to quantify scale-specific management effects. Using an ecosystem experiment and monitoring data, time series analyses (1998–2019) revealed significant multiscale temporal (and thus panarchy) structure for littoral invertebrates across limed and reference lakes. Such patterns were inconsistent for sublittoral invertebrates and phytoplankton. When significant panarchy structure was found, Ca:Mg ratios correlated with only a few of the identified temporal fluctuation frequencies across limed and reference lakes. This suggests that liming effects become diluted in the managed lakes. The lack of manifestations of liming across the independent temporal fluctuation patterns suggest that this lake management form fails to create and enforce cross-scale interactions, a crucial component of ecological resilience. This interpretation supports liming as a mitigation effort rather than a tool to restore acidified lakes to a self-organizing system equivalent of circumneutral references.",12,1,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Some phytoplankton groups respond rapidly to these factors to photosynthesize and multiply in very short time scales. It is therefore crucial to understand these dynamics at a high temporal resolution to capture these critical time points of interaction. Significant changes in the phytoplankton communities could occur within a few hours, which cannot be resolved in low-temporal resolution studies. We hypothesize that the response to these altering nutrient regimes and environmental factors is more immediate and prominent in cyanobacteria when compared to other groups of phytoplankton. Nutrients and phytoplankton dynamics were monitored every 2 hours for 72 hours in a shallow polymictic lake. Additionally, in-situ sensors measured other parameters simultaneously. Pulse amplitude modulation (Phyto-PAM and Microscopy-PAM) was employed to observe the changes in phytoplankton physiology.&nbsp; Although the water chemistry did not vary significantly during this period, cyanobacteria showed rapid responses to other existing environmental factors within a few hours by forming surface accumulations. Microscopic observations highlighted diel migrations within certain cyanobacterial species.

The required input data are discharge and nutrient concentration for a time series. To demonstrate the utility of the R function, a detailed comparative study was conducted using datasets from five German reservoirs (Droeda, Rappbode, Bautze, Grosse Dhuenn and Poehl) based on annual load estimates for orthophosphate (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP). The similarities and differences between these four methods were analyzed, and a comparative evaluation of nutrient retention efficiencies in these different water bodies was conducted. Finally, options for using the tool for future-proof adaptive management are discussed.",13,5,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Knowledge of the biomass, structure and profile, accumulation rate, and extent of fouling is critical to understand the risk and, potentially, guide management actions. To address this need, three optical approaches to quantify biofouling were evaluated: 1. 3D white light scanning system for analysis of panels and structures removed from water; 2. an inexpensive, underwater digital camera paired with a custom routine for classifying fouling in 2D images; and 3. 3D underwater laser scanner for <em>in situ</em> analysis. <em>Ex situ</em>, 3D imaging was performed immediately after removing submerged test items. If a pre-treatment scan was not available, the item was rescanned following cleaning to reveal its base structure allowing precise measurements of biovolume, surface roughness, and fouling extent. This approach was well-suited to irregular objects (propellors) upon removal from the water. Under ideal conditions, an inexpensive camera produced digital images with the color range and contrast that allowed estimates of areal coverage and classification into general fouling groups. These two approaches are compared to an underwater laser scanner, ideal for <em>in situ</em> evaluations of submerged surfaces, tested in a tank with natural seawater in Key West, FL. Capabilities and limitations of each approach will influence its use as an analytical tool and its value in guiding management decisions.",10,16,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Despite efforts to reduce nutrient loads, many systems continue to show little to no signs of recovery to date. In the Baltic Sea, concerted and costly measures have significantly reduced the inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) since the 1980s, but the state of the sea has not improved. To understand why, we compared a simulation of the ecosystem&nbsp;with continued high loads to the current state of the sea. While the state has not improved yet, without load reductions, it would be considerably worse. Specifically, winter concentrations of nutrients and&nbsp;primary production as an indicator of algal blooms would be about 1.5&nbsp;to 2 times higher than today in the Baltic Proper. Further, the extent of oxygen-free bottoms would be about 1.4 times&nbsp;larger.&nbsp;Due to the slow turnover time of the system and a statistical anomaly in the current climatic conditions, improvements in the eutrophication state cannot be seen yet, but a simulation continuing with current nutrient loads into the future shows that conditions will likely improve in the coming decades. The results of this study underscore the significance of acting on early warning signs of eutrophication, particularly in enclosed coastal waters. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of sustained efforts to decrease nutrient loads to reduce the severity of eutrophication and its adverse consequences.",3,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

A promising opportunity to enhance MPA effectiveness.,"Climate anomalies and marine heat waves (MHWs) - discrete periods of prolonged anomalously warm water at a particular location - have been increasing in frequency and intensity over the past decades. This phenomenon is usually associated with mass mortality events (MMEs), especially of benthic species. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one of the most effective management measures but often do not represent an effective tool to protect benthic sessile species from these events, focussing mainly their efforts on fish stock recovery and on the reduction of anthropic threats, rarely considering climate change exposure. In this context, the objective of this study is to include new insights into the selection and prioritization of candidate areas along the Italian coasts for future effective species-based conservation and restoration measures, to mitigate climate change effects. Candidate areas’ selection aims to enhance success probabilities during the current climate crisis. The approach proposed here consider the bathymetric range of each area and the detection and characterization of MHW events over the past decades as well as the possible occurrence of MMEs. To test this approach, 29 Italian MPAs were used as a model and classified based on their bathymetric characteristics, their exposure to MHWs and the estimated resilience of their benthic populations after MMEs. Since &nbsp;the mesophotic zone can support recovery processes of shallow assemblages and enhance local resilience, it’s proximity or inclusion into the MPAs extension was also considered. &nbsp;An expansion of 0.5 km of radius around their current extension was hypothesized, to include the mesophotic zone. This zone can facilitate recovery processes of shallow assemblages and enhance local resilience. MPA expansions were, thus, classified on the basis of their bathymetric characteristics, their exposure to MHWs and the recovery of their benthic populations after MMEs. The presented approach could support decision-makers, driving future management strategies by identifying areas with higher probability to recover from the effects of future climate conditions.",2,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Portixol 1,

Due to increasing demand for hi-tech metals, rising interest to start mining concretions from the Baltic Sea is inevitable. The concretions host diverse microbial communities that can affect both the concretion growth and dissolution rates. It is crucial that the ecosystem is not damaged while concretions are extracted. This project provides information on the recovery and sustainable use of Baltic Sea ferromanganese concretions as a source of hi-tech metals. The ferromanganese concretions were collected from the Baltic Sea during May-June 2022 for laboratory incubation and metal tracer experiments. We assessed the concretion growth with nano-computed tomography and a scanning electron microscope, and measured the production of methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. Metal accumulation will be assessed based on geochemical analysis of the solution and microanalysis of the concretions with laser-ablation ICP-MS.

We found increased Cr, Cu and Hg accumulation in roots and As in leaves of transplanted plants, confirming that <em>P. oceanica</em> may act as a sink, sequestering TEs and potentially decreasing their availability, but also opening questions about the potential risk of remobilising buried contaminants. At the same time, fish assemblages showed signs of rapid recovery in both areas, i.e., an increase in species richness, abundance, and diversity from the first month after transplantation, indicating a rapid improvement in habitat provision function.

We compared metrics linked to key ecosystem services across three salt marsh sites on the Upper Texas Coast (USA): two restored sites (10 and 20 years old) and a reference site. The restored sites resembled the reference area in terms of emergent plant cover (primarily <em>Spartina alterniflora</em>), but metrics linked to ecosystem services indicated that restored sites did not provide a full range of comparable functions. Carbon sequestration potential in the older restored site, as estimated by root biomass and soil organic content, approached that of the reference site. However, trophic support for coastal food webs differed among sites; restored sites had up to 4x more infauna but half as much benthic microalgae. The older restored site showed evidence of substantial subsidence and loss of higher elevation habitat, indicating that restored sites, unlike reference areas, do not have a high elevation refuge for retreat in response to sea level rise. Overall, when considering metrics of ecosystem function, the restored sites are providing a unique set of values to the coastal ecosystem, but these functions may not persist over time under pressure from sea level rise.

Despite accounting for &lt;1% of Earth’s surface area, it is predicted that these systems can remove between 20-90% of terrestrial nitrogen inputs. However, globally they are at risk as sea level rise (SLR) is quickly outpacing rates of salt marsh net elevation gain. One SLR adaptation strategy increasingly used on the east coast of the United States, is thin layer placement (TLP). In TLP, sediment is placed on the surface of the marsh to boost elevation. Yet the impact of adding this sediment on salt marsh biogeochemical cycling remains largely unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are using a combination of slurry experiments and&nbsp;<em>in situ&nbsp;</em>measurements to address this knowledge gap. In the summer of 2022, we found that anammox was undetectable in both control and TLP plots, while potential denitrification was approximately 3.5X higher in the TLP plots than the control plots. Additionally in the summer of 2021, we found that nitrous oxide fluxes (another product of nitrogen removal) from both TLP and control plots were not significantly different from zero (p&gt;0.05, n= 30).&nbsp;&nbsp;We will present these data along with ongoing measurements of&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;rates using the push pull and isotope paring technique.

We measured GHG emissions in different habitat types at river Elbe in Germany, to assess the effect of intra-system variability as well as diurnal variability on GHG emission upscaling.

In spring blooms, fluxes from phytoplankton to bacteria dominated, and a succession from phytoplankton to consecutive bacterial ASVs occurred. Vice versa, successions of abundant bacterial ASVs in bacterial summer blooms were followed by an increase of phytoplankton, culminating in phytoplankton summer blooms. Both types of summer blooms, however, were characterized by high bacteria to bacteria carbon fluxes, with the same magnitude as fluxes from phytoplankton to bacteria in bacterial summer blooms. Utilization patterns of hypothetical DOC species suggest that carbon processing in periods with high internal heterotrophic recycling are dominated by generalist utilization, whereas in periods with high phytoplankton to bacteria fluxes, specialist strategies dominate.

Despite their large contribution to global methane emissions, methane emissions from ponds are incredibly variable, contributing to substantial uncertainty in global methane budgets. Differences in pond mixing dynamics are a likely cause of variability in greenhouse gas emissions as mixing events increase oxygen availability throughout the water column and a majority of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is produced under anoxic conditions. Additionally, mixing events results in the venting of gasses that build in bottom waters during periods of stratification. This study quantifies the impact of mixing events on greenhouse gas concentrations in the surface and bottom waters of four temperate, experimental ponds. In 2021 and 2022, we sampled surface and bottom water CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) gases every two weeks and continuously monitored temperature throughout the water column to assess mixing. All ponds mixed intermittently throughout the study period. Both CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were highest in pond bottom waters during periods of summer stratification and highest gas concentrations were correlated with longer periods of stratification and bottom water hypoxia. Our study reveals that greenhouse gas concentrations buildup during periods of stratification, and intermittent mixing can lead to pulses of high emissions, explaining some of the temporal variability in pond greenhouse gas emissions. &nbsp;",0,30,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Effluent from wastewater treatment facilities is one such source of low pH, high DIC, and high nitrogen water to the coastline. However, wastewater discharge has the potential to be leveraged as a delivery method for alkalinity to the ocean, resulting in modulation of the acidifying effects of nitrogen-rich effluent and increasing the carbon sequestration capacity of the ocean itself. This study seeks to describe the contribution of wastewater discharge to coastal carbonate chemistry in Buzzards Bay on the East Coast of North America, considering the impacts of both traditional wastewater facilities and a facility that adds alkalinity to wastewater during processing. Carbonate system data were collected across four sites via discrete and jetyak sampling in the discharge zones of wastewater treatment facilities. Biogeochemical tracer experiments modeling discharge chemistry were performed to estimate effluent plume behavior over a kilometer away from the discharge point source. From these observations, we aim to analyze the contribution of wastewater to the overall state of the coastal carbonate system, the strength and persistence of the effluent plume signature at each site, and site characteristics contributing to plume behavior.

An enormous potential is found in biotechnological techniques to open the algae cells to harvest for a variety of biomolecules that can be processed in several industries like the energy sector, medical science and the food industry. Therefore, competent algae cell wall polymer active enzymes (ACWPAEs) need to be established.

Results and outreach: Analyses of released sugar concentration within algae enrichment cultures hint to a dynamic degradation community. The majority of the bacterial composition was made up by Pseudomonadota, while genes in the metagenomen associated with Bacteroidota only made up a small fraction.

Besides that, climate change and direct anthropogenic pressures trigger alterations in hydrology and thermal structure which could modify carbon fluxes and water quality in these ecosystems. This study tackles the effect of hydrological and thermal structure changes in carbon fluxes in a Mediterranean reservoir (El Gergal, Spain) measuring CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes from water surface, CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from drawdown areas and the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> in the hypolimnion. The results showed that hydrology and thermal structure have an impact on carbon fluxes in the reservoir affecting CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes. During stratification, water level is lower, increasing drawdown areas and, therefore, rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from these surfaces. In addition, stratification and lower water renewal enhance anoxia in the bottom of the reservoir promoting anaerobic respiration of organic matter. This leads to higher production of CH4 that together with lower water level will increase diffusive and ebullitive fluxes of CH<sub>4</sub>. Furthermore, anaerobic processes produce reduced substances (e.g. HS<sup>-</sup>), impairing water quality, and accumulate CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> in the hypolimnion that could be released to the atmosphere during fall turnover. These results suggest that longer stratification periods with more frequent and intense droughts, which lead to low water episodes with higher residence time and higher risk of anoxia, will impair water quality and enhance the carbon emissions of reservoirs.",1,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Sala Portixol 2,

Due to global warming the magnitude of GHG release from lakes is posed to increase. And although this is a well recognized fact, there remains uncertainties in our knowledge on lake GHG fluxes. This is due to several reasons: remote locations of such lakes often make research logistically difficult, the environmental conditions can be rough for research infrastructure and the most commonly used flux chamber method is heavily biased towards daytime flux values. Here, we introduce preliminary results based on a three year long dataset of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes collected via the eddy covariance (EC) method over a large subarctic Lake Pallasjärvi in Finnish Lapland. The site is located in a unique position where on one hand the southern lobe of the EC footprint represents fluxes from a small and shallow bay which receives runoff from the surrounding forest and peatland, and on the other hand, the northern lobe extends to the large and deep main basin of the lake, the data thus representing essentially two different lakes. EC measurements are supplemented by water side measurements of pCO2, pCH4 and temperature stratification as well as flux chamber measurements. This dataset provides a look into the often overlooked aspects of lake gas flux research: diurnal variation of fluxes, fluxes during the spring overturn period and in general observations over a large subarctic lake, on which measurements from past are few and far between.",3,24,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Using data from deployments in the Sargasso Sea, we found that particle numbers throughout the water column better correlate with beam attenuation than total particle volume. This results from the fact that larger particles are rare events which contribute to total particle volume but are undetected by the transmissometer.

To quantify how changes in flow regime drive OC cycling, we estimated ecosystem metabolism (gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER)) and OC spiraling metrics of 10 streams spanning a precipitation gradient across the coastal plains and piney woods ecoregions in Texas, USA.

Overfishing and resultant weakened herbivory pressure can drive or maintain shifts from coral to algal dominance, motivating research on novel methods to quantify the strength of herbivory on algal-dominated reefs. Traditionally, quantifying changes in herbivory pressures requires long-term data and/or population models, which can be expensive and time consuming. However, trait-based ecology, an approach commonly applied in terrestrial ecosystems, but rarely on marine algae, could provide a simpler and rapid approach for estimating herbivory on tropical reefs. We tested this hypothesis on five fringing reefs on Moorea, French Polynesia. We estimated herbivory with a consumption bioassay and measured seven algal traits related to herbivory (volume, height, wet and dry weight, percent calcification, tensile strength, and toughness) of a randomly collected calcifying macroalgae, Halimeda opuntia. Herbivory differed significantly among the 5 sites (ANOVA p &lt;0.0001), with an ~ 8-fold difference between the lowest and highest pressures. Algal traits varied concomitantly; algae from high herbivory sites were significantly larger, allocated more mass to structure, and were more functionally diverse (PERMANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001). To link trait and herbivory pressure variation, we conducted a field experiment manipulating fish herbivory (none, ambient, simulated). Simulated and ambient herbivory occupied similar trait space in a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), confirming that herbivory drove these trait differences. Our results provide strong support that trait-based ecology is a powerful approach for estimating herbivory on macroalgal-dominated coral reefs.",3,38,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Thermal structures of lakes display this interaction, with projected increases in water temperatures and changes to stratification phenology set to initiate chains of biogeochemical and ecological processes detrimental to water quality. Dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion leads to unwanted hypoxic/anoxic conditions, highlighting climate induced water quality changes. However, predicting oxygen dynamics is difficult, with in situ oxygen depletion rates showing considerable lake dependent variability, and different mechanisms at play. For example, climate warming leads to stratification elongation and potential increases in hypolimnion temperature, resulting in linearly and exponentially increasing DO depletion, respectively. Using DO depletion rates from literature reflecting variability in trophic state, we quantified the typical DO depletion rates ranges for oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic lakes and included their sensitivity against temperature for a broader climate-impact assessment.

These ecosystems have provided resources for several civilizations throughout the centuries and their ecological and limnological properties have been affected by the synergetic interactions among climate variability and human activities. Both lakes have shown evidences of increased eutrophication during the last decades. This contribution summarizes the available sedimentological, geochemical and isotopic data for both lakes and the intensive monitoring carried out in Estanya since the winter of 2022. The multiproxy analysis of the sedimentary sequences includes the study of facies, elemental geochemistry and the isotopic signatures of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in several endogenic materials. Both lakes have experimented drastic changes in the agricultural land uses of their watersheds since Roman times, which have led to significant fluctuations in their sedimentation rates, depositional environments, eutrophication and oxygenation conditions. The isotope signatures are coherent with the sedimentological changes described in both lakes, in terms of increased watershed erosion during Roman, Medieval and Recent times, and large hydrological changes. The timing, structure and dynamics of past environmental crises in the lakes could help to understand on-going eutrophication changes and to better develop mitigation strategies to respond to global changes in the Mediterranean regions.",5,39,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Such habitats will be among the first to show signs of climate induced change due to their low thermal inertia. Thus, obtaining reference values of the upper thermal limits and acclimation capacity of such species is crucial to understand species range shifts and distinguish future genetic adaptation from natural thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity. This work investigated the Critical Thermal Maxima (CTMax) of 16 species of marine gastropods, common dwellers of shallow waters in tropical (N=8 species) and temperate (N=8 species) Atlantic regions. They were tested after seven days at a control temperature (29ºC for the tropical species and 22ºC for the temperate species); after 10 days at control + 3ºC; and after 30 days at control + 3ºC. These experimental points allow the calculation of the acclimation capacity of the CTMax value, for each species, after a heat wave (10 days) and after chronic warming (30 days). The acclimation capacity of tropical species was generally lower than that of temperate species, on both timescales tested. The CTMax of some of the tropical species decreased after exposure to higher temperatures, which did not occur for any of the temperate species tested. The maximum habitat temperatures of coastal waters are well below the CTMax of all species, both tropical and temperate. The Thermal Safety Margin (TSM=CTMax-Maximum Habitat Temperature) calculated for tide pools, revealed that half of the tropical species tested present a negative TSM. All tropical species tested have negative TSM when considering future habitat temperatures with an increase of 3ºC, rendering tide pools as ecological traps for these species. TSM is positive for all temperate species, and it generally increases when accounting for the acclimation capacity of each species. When using +3ºC future habitat temperatures, three temperate species present negative TSM values, however when accounting for acclimation capacity, at both timescales, TSM is positive for all species. This means that tide pools are not ecological traps for these temperate gastropods, nor are they predicted to be in the future.",6,42,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

While the frequency and intensity of extreme events are projected to increase under climate change, its impacts on seagrass ecosystems remain poorly documented. In January 2020, the Spanish Mediterranean coast was hit by Storm Gloria, one of the most devastating recent climate events due to its intensity and duration. We conducted rapid surveys across the region to evaluate the extent and type of impact (burial, unburial or uprooting) and the impact on the carbon stored in these carbon sinks. We assessed the importance of oceanographic (i.e. modelled wave impact), geomorphological (latitude, longitude, depth, exposure) and structural (patchiness) factors in predicting the extent of the impact and its intensity. The main impact of Storm Gloria was shoot unburial; more than half of the sites we surveyed had &gt;50% of the meadow showing recent unburial of up to 40 cm of sediment removed severely compromising carbon stocks in the meadows. Crucially, exposed and patchy meadows were much more vulnerable to the overall impact than sheltered or continuous meadows. Given the slow recovery of P. oceanica after disturbances, it could take from decades to centuries for these losses to be recovered. As part of the ecological infrastructure of the coast and their key role in climate change mitigation, protecting seagrass from anthropogenic impacts and fragmentation is the best strategy for maintaining the resilience of these ancient ecosystems against the climate crisis. fragmentation is the best hope for maintaining the resilience of these ecosystems against the climate crisis.",7,40,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In eastern boundary upwelling systems, planktonic copepods dominate the zooplankton biomass, being crucial in the marine food web. Yet, they must cope with severe hypoxia caused by shoaling of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Here, we show that the metabolic rate of three abundant copepod species increases during the upwelling season, so better exploiting the spring phytoplankton bloom for feeding and reproduction. However, their critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) also increases, revealing no adjustment to withstand seasonal hypoxia. Furthermore, their Pcrit based hypoxia tolerance strongly correlate to their species-specific water column distribution. Experiencing oxygen levels ≤ Pcrit is common (ca. 70% of occurrence) for copepods inhabiting the photic zone, and so exacerbated hypoxia, driven by ongoing ocean deoxygenation and increased upwelling, will increment copepod mortality and change population dynamics, leading to drastic consequences for marine food webs.",2,,6/7/23 15:00,6/7/23 16:30,Sala Ibiza A,

Anthropogenic activities contributed to water scarcity and quality decrease: some sections dried out, and others are biological or chemical contaminated. To estimate the status of a RB/G section, we sampled three sites along the river (Juárez-El Paso metroplex) for metal (Al, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, and As), and microplastic (MPs) determination in water, and two sites, for sediments. We collected three grab water and composed sediment samples per site for metal analysis and concentrated 30L of water through a plankton net for MPs detection. Samples digested in acid or hydrogen peroxide before spectroscopy or fluorescence microscopy analysis: MPs determination required a separation and dye processes too.

The objective of the present work was to characterize six common macroalgae species of the Basque Coast: green (<em>Ulva rigida</em> and <em>Codium</em> <em>decorticatum</em>, Chlorophyta), brown (<em>Bifurcaria bifurcata</em> and <em>Halopteris scoparia</em>, Phaeophyceae, Ochrophyta) and red (<em>Halopithys incurva</em> and <em>Chondracanthus acicularis</em>, Rhodophyta). The species were collected along the Basque Coast from May to September 2022, and some biochemical and microbiological analyses were made. Regarding pigments, green and brown macrophytes showed the highest values of chlorophylls and carotenoids (β-carotene, fucoxanthin and lutein), while phycobilins were in higher concentrations in red macroalgae. On the other hand, in relation to chemical contamination, maximum values of metals were shown in<em> B. bifucaria</em> and <em>H. incurva</em>. Finally, concerning microorganisms, the results showed that in all the species, when pathogenic microorganisms were detected, it has been at low densities. Furthermore, the washing or freezing of algae affected microbial contents, showing in both cases an almost total reduction of studied microorganisms. These findings provide support for the quality of seaweed regarding healthy biocompounds such as pigments. However, it is important to take into account the chemical and microbiological characterization for avoiding healthy risks.",2,56,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Studies have linked these declines with climate-driven ecosystem regime shifts in the North Pacific Ocean. However, with limited knowledge of high seas distribution,<em> </em>the mechanisms linking climate and salmon ecology remain unclear. Here, we analyze historic data to better understand the patterns, mechanisms, and consequences of climate-driven ocean ecosystem change. Using reconstructed abundances, scale growth measurements, and multi-isotope analysis of a 100-year archive of fisheries-collected salmon scales, we assess the marine distribution of Pacific salmon and investigate time-varying relationships between ocean climate and salmon abundance, growth, and ecosystem condition. We find considerable variation in ecological trends reconstructed from nitrogen, carbon, and sulphur isotope measurements and estimate regions of population-specific high seas distribution using isotopic correlations with environmental time series. We detect non-stationary relationships between salmon ecology and climate factors such as Pacific Decadal Oscillation and reconstructed North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. This research develops understanding of the marine ecology of Pacific salmon and of how an increasingly variable climate may impact ocean ecosystems.",5,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Sala Menorca A,

However, the construction of barriers and flood protection measures has led to a severe fragmentation of river networks which is also impacting the river meta-ecosystem. Only during the past 25 years, measures to improve connectivity have been implemented. While continuum interruptions must be considered on four different dimensions (longitudinal, lateral, vertical, temporal), we focus on the longitudinal dimension by applying the meta ecosystem concept in order to assess connectivity changes in the Austrian Danube system. To do so, connectivity indices are calculated based on assumptions regarding barrier passability and dispersal distances of local potamodromous fish species. Our results demonstrate severe connectivity changes and underline the importance of managing river networks as a meta-ecosystem rather than focusing on individual and potentially disconnected sites. In this way, we are not disregarding exchange processes such as fish migrations and other movement patterns which are crucial in order to ensure long-lasting ecological integrity and are reflecting the overall functionality of the system.",3,,6/8/23 15:00,6/8/23 16:30,Sala Menorca A,

Food availability is affected by the productivity of the river, which could vary due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. Trophic interactions can vary spatially and temporally which can affect prey availability. There is a lack of studies on food availability and trophic relationships on the species' northern-most range, which have yet to experience adverse effects of climate change like their southern counterparts. By understanding how the food web changes over time and space, river managers will be able to implement the proper tools that stimulate productivity. The study aim was to investigate how spatial and temporal changes in the food web affect the population dynamics of juvenile Atlantic salmon in their northern-most global distribution. Field sampling of algae, invertebrate and juvenile salmonids were conducted to better understand the food availability for salmon and build food webs at different sites and time during the main growth period in the summer. The study was confined to four direct run-off rivers in Northeast Iceland. Food webs were built and compared using the r package CHEDDAR. The study showed that juvenile salmon in Northeast Iceland consumed prey items that were more readily available (<em>Chironomidae</em>), whereas salmonids in southern Europe would seek prey with high biomass.

We examine the factors mediating the spatial distribution of the toothcarp and mosquitofish, including water quality variables, connection, and distance to the seawater. Fish sampling was carried out in 21 isolated or connected coastal lagoons in winter and summer by means of fyke nets and minnow traps. The physicochemical variables were registered, and lagoons were classified as connected or isolated from the sea. Multivariate and univariate modelling showed that relative abundance of Spanish toothcarp increased in lagoons not very close or permanently connected to the sea, probably due to the presence of marine migrant species that are potential predators. By contrast, mosquitofish abundance was not clearly related to distance to the seawater and was more related to water quality properties. Therefore, we suggest that the endangered species finds refuge in more isolated lagoons and that hypersaline conditions might not be the only factor essential for the species conservation.

However, high densities among conspecifics lead to animal disease outbreaks in these settings. One long-standing disease, Puffy Snout Syndrome (PSS), causes localized, collagenous tissue growths on the head in Scombrid fishes (e.g., tuna, mackerel, and bonitos). To date, PSS has only been documented in captive-held fish populations and is associated with high mortality rates. Little is known about PSS's causative agent(s) and the immune responses it elicits. Therefore, we leveraged ‘Omics and culture-based methods to evaluate PSS infections in three groups of Pacific mackerel (<em>Scomber japonicus</em>) -- symptomatic-captive, asymptomatic-captive, and healthy wild-caught. Our aims were to 1) analyze gene pathways active in the host immune response to PSS, 2) characterize the viral community, and 3) culture and sequence the causative viral pathogen. Host transcripts showed numerous tumorigenesis and stress-related genes overexpressed in captive-held animals. Viral transcripts revealed multiple polymerase genes for Iridoviridae and Nodaviridae, both of which are known disease agents in juvenile tuna. Viral culture elicited cytopathic effect over three passages in cell lines, with prominent syncytia formation.

The impacts of peacock bass on fish assemblages were appraised, using years since introduction as a proxy of its cumulative impacts. Random forests highlighted maximum depth, introduced status, and ecosystem type as the best predictors of the peacock bass relative abundance, which ranged 0.01–26.0%, increased with maximum depth, was highest in invaded reservoirs but decreased with depth in native riverine populations. Other factors such as climate or limnological features were less important in explaining <em>C. ocellaris</em> abundance, which did not vary markedly with years since introduction. Variation partitioning showed that hydrographic region followed by limnological and reservoir features accounted for most explained variation, indicating a strong historical and local influence. Introduction time varied among hydrographic regions, indicating invasion pathways not linked to geographical proximity, and accounted for 5–8% of variation in species composition and diversity, independently of limnological features.

Habitat heterogeneity of ocean environments has been considered lower than in terrestrial areas and the effects of climate change would be small because organisms can shift their distribution in response to environmental changes. However, some demersal fish species are sedentary and strongly associated with specific topographic and bottom conditions, and furthermore, ocean currents have been reported to influence their distribution. Such species may have difficulty in shifting their distribution under climate changes and may be prone to habitat loss. We constructed a generalized linear mixed model using the catch per unit effort of 30 benthic fish species (including 6 subspecies) off the North Pacific Ocean around Japan as response variables and analyzed the factors affecting their spatial distribution. Explanatory variables were bottom water temperature, bottom density (an indicator of ocean currents), water depth, topographic complexity, and sediment thickness. The results revealed that 18 species had a lower AICc when bottom density was included in the models. These trends mean that the distribution of demersal fishes is determined by a combination of currents and bottom sediments in response to water temperature, suggesting that the distributional shifts of fishes may not be easy due to the high heterogeneity of the ocean environment.

While these fishes rely on water flow to direct odors into their nose, there are few studies on the fluid dynamics of their olfaction. With an odor-impeding boundary layer and no direct pump-like system, how do these fishes efficiently capture chemical stimuli? To understand how nasal morphology influences chemical detection, models of 4 nasal morphotypes seen in batoids were 3D printed and mounted in a water tunnel and the incoming flow was visualized using particle image velocimetry methods. Models were tested at varied Reynolds numbers, respiratory processes, and head pitch angles. To obtain velocity data, a continuous wave laser beam was spread into a thin sheet by a cylindrical lens. The resulting laser sheet was oriented to illuminate streamwise cross-sections of the flow near the nostrils. Image sequences were cross-correlated to determine the local flow velocity. We found that different nasal geometries produce different patterns of flow and odor capture mechanisms. Pitch and respiratory processes are also crucial parameters for odor detection.

The genetic approach included phylogenetic analyses and different distance and tree based molecular species delimitation tools. The morphological approach included microscopic techniques. Seven undescribed <em>Amphiglena</em> genetic lineages compatible with the unified species concept were found in this study adding to the other seven species already reported in the Italian coasts and Madeira. Western Mediterranean species showed restricted and, in some cases, sympatric distributions, indicating no genetic flow between taxa regardless proximity.

To date, studies on aquatic plants have mainly focused on the role of mono-specific seagrass stands, typically ignoring that the coastal zone can be heterogeneous, where multiple species with a range of trait characteristics may influence carbon storage differently across seasons. With few studies having assessed how functional traits link to carbon storage in aquatic plant communities, we sought to explore (<em>i</em>) the relationship between functional community composition and biomass-bound carbon stocks, and (<em>ii</em>) seasonal fluctuations of non-structural carbohydrates in different plant species. We conducted multiple field surveys (i.e., October, March, June and August) in the Baltic Sea, Finland, where we sampled six soft-bottom communities dominated by aquatic vascular plants and measured nine traits that capture the key variation in plant life-history strategies. We found that functional composition was associated with plant carbon stocks and this relationship was mediated by seasonality. Non-structural carbohydrates varied significantly through time, with the amount stored in leaf tissue throughout winter being tied to functional characteristics of the leaves. Our results indicate that the underlying biological mechanisms influencing carbon storage are affected by community trait composition, underlining the importance of using functional traits as a tool to assess the role of aquatic plant biodiversity for ecosystem functioning.",1,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Portixol 1,

Here, we experimentally investigated the effect of different submerged macrophyte species, with similar or distinct complexity, on phosphorus (P) retention in recirculating artificial streams. Two experiments were performed in 12 artificial channels during 3 days each. Macrophyte complexity was estimated by the fractal dimension at patch scale (FD), and P retention (k) was calculated as the slope of the relationship between P concentration (in ln) and time, and standardized by macrophyte biomass. In the first experiment, we estimated P retention in two macrophyte species (<em>Egeria densa</em> and <em>Stuckenia striata</em>) of similar complexity, alone or combined. We observed no significant differences neither in k nor in FD among treatments. In the second experiment, we compared P retention in 3 species with different complexities (<em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Egeria densa</em> and <em>Elodea ernstae</em>). We found that k differed significantly among treatments, being higher in <em>Elodea </em>(the species with the highest FD), intermediate in <em>Ceratophyllum</em>, and lower in <em>Egeria</em> (k = 0.0098, 0.0065, and 0.0049 1/h, respectively).

Ecological stoichiometry (ES) is commonly used to evaluate animal-mediated nutrient recycling. However, empirical data on vertebrates rarely supports ES predictions, both because elemental demand and release do not appear tightly linked to body elemental content and because vertebrates often break the assumption of stoichiometric homeostasis (<em style=""background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"">i.e. </em>that body elemental content remains within bounds as environmental supply fluctuates). Bone, a phosphorus(P)-rich tissue, likely plays a significant role. We systematically reviewed zoological and medical literature to evaluate (1) how bone physiology impacts vertebrate elemental demand and release, (2) how bone causes stoichiometric flexibility, and (3) how bone density varies across both bone types and species. We found that not only does bone change body elemental content, but it also functions directly in mineral homeostasis, complicating how P content affects demand in vertebrates. Additionally, bone (1) can increase or decrease in density depending on environmental conditions, changing body P content, and (2) can substitute elements within its mineral structure, changing its stoichiometry. These two factors, along with bone’s unique role in female reproductive biology, make bone a key trait for understanding stoichiometry. We also found that bone is extremely variable both within and across species, further supporting its role in defining vertebrate P content and elemental flexibility.&nbsp;",2,62,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, similar systems are largely unstudied in lakes. We hypothesized that steep reefs in deep lakes (“lakemounts”) act as seamounts. In a preliminary study, we monitored water temperature and compared fish and benthic invertebrate diversity nearshore (NS) and around a lakemount (LM) in Lake Champlain, US. In a 20-day period, the thermocline oscillated around 15 m depth. We observed two seiche events that upwelled cold water, both with 4 days duration. Temperature was positively related to NE winds (t=1.95, p=0.05) and negatively related to SSW winds (t=-5.14, p&lt;0.001), indicating formation of a wind-driven seiche. Taxonomic richness was higher at the NS than LM site (12 <em>vs</em> 11 fish species, and 25 <em>vs</em> 20 benthic taxa, respectively). Shannon-Weiner diversity (H) and Evenness (evar) indices showed that NS benthos had higher diversity and evenness compared to the LM benthic community (H=2.2 <em>vs</em> 1.7; evar=0.7 <em>vs</em> 0.6; NS vs LM, respectively), while the fish diversity and evenness were higher in the LM (H=1.5 <em>vs</em> 1.8; evar 0.6 <em>vs</em> 0.7; NS <em>vs</em> LM, respectively). Salmonids were present only at the LM and insects were exclusively in the NS, while other taxonomic groups were similar between the habitats. Zooplankton samples remain to be processed.

The causes of allometric scaling of respiration rate in colonial animals are unclear, past studies have indicated that colony shape or integration may be important traits related to scaling factor. To test which factors influence allometric scaling in colonial animals we estimated three novel scaling factors for colonial rotifers and collected known scaling factors for 37 colonial animals from the literature. The novel scaling factors were estimated by measuring respiration rate and colony size. Respiration rate was measured using a Loligo microplate system. After oxygen measurement, colony size was determined from photographs with ImageJ. We estimated a scaling factor of 0.5 to 1.0 for colonial rotifers. Scaling factors were collected from the literature focusing on colonies that present some level of physiological or morphological integration, including modular organisms as well as siphonophores and eusocial insects. A linear mixed regression with hierarchical taxonomic ranks as random effects showed that traits significantly related to allometric scaling factor in colonial animals included colony shape, with globular and linear colonies associated with isometric scaling, whereas unattached lifestyle and the presence of shared extra zooidal structures was related to a lower allometric scaling factor (marginal r-squared: 0.40).

Their rapid spread is matched by a remarkable capacity to filter particulates from the water column with profound effects on local ecosystems. In the North American Great Lakes, quagga mussel populations have increased inexorably since the late 1980’s, but it remains unclear whether quagga mussels will follow a similar trajectory in Europe where they have appeared more recently. Here we apply knowledge from a 34-year quagga population monitoring effort in the North American Great Lakes to predict future quagga populations in deep European lakes, where quaggas are quickly becoming a conspicuous part of the underwater landscape. We predict that quagga mussel biomass in Lakes Biel, Constance, and Geneva may increase by a factor of 9 – 20 by 2045. Like in North America, this increase will likely be characterized by a shift to larger individuals and deeper depths as the population matures. If realized, this rapid expansion of quagga mussels would likely drive the largest aquatic ecosystem change in deep European lakes since the eutrophication period of the mid-20th century.",3,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Portixol 1,

Parasites are ubiquitous consumers in ecosystems, yet it is unknown whether predators can regulate the feeding behavior of parasites and yield similar cascading impacts. Because of their unique position at the interface between the body of the host and the physical environment, ectoparasites may be particularly sensitive to the NCEs of predators, yet the interaction between consumer non-consumptive effects and ectoparasite feeding activity has not yet been investigated. Here, we investigated the effects of a common ectoparasite (Boonea impressa) density and predator-associated olfactory cues on the feeding activity of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica). Scent exposure assays demonstrated that Boonea reduced feeding on oyster hosts when exposed predator-associated cues. A laboratory mesocosm study in which we manipulated the density of ectoparasites and the presence of predatory crab olfactory cues showed that ectoparasites reduced oyster biofiltration rate, and that these effects are mediated by both parasite density and predator olfactory cues. Mud crab non-consumptive effects can flip from negative to positive in the presence of ectoparasites. Our findings represent the first demonstration of a predator influencing the feeding of ectoparasites in their hosts through NCEs, a phenomenon which may be common in nature. Additionally, our results highlight the potentially complex web of trait-mediated interactions that may influence ectoparasite feeding activity and oyster reef functioning.

Spatial effects (lakes in the same watershed) were&nbsp;significantly less important for predicting occurrences of rare species as compared with the 27&nbsp;common&nbsp;fish species, while abiotic predictors were similarly strong for common and rare species. Strong negative residual correlations between rare and common species indicating predator-prey or competitive interactions were the exception.

Outside of this range, oysters face physiological stress that impacts growth and survival. Estuaries are impacted by climate change as variation in severity and duration of extreme precipitation events (drought and flood) alters the amount of freshwater entering estuarine systems. Elevated estuarine salinity levels facilitate colonization by predators that are typically limited in abundance by lower salinity estuarine water. In high predation environments, oysters induce morphological shell defenses to produce thicker, stronger shells that confer greater resistance to predation. However, oysters' ability to induce morphological defenses may be limited in suboptimal salinities due to heightened physiological stress. Although oysters will likely face suboptimal salinities and increased predation pressure simultaneously, little is known regarding the impact of salinity on oysters’ ability to induce morphological predation defenses. Here, I exposed juvenile oysters to three salinity regimes in the presence or absence of predatory gastropod cues. I tracked oyster growth and survival over ten weeks and measured changes in wet weight, shell weight, and shell area to test my hypothesis that oysters grown in suboptimal salinity regimes will produce shells that are lighter and thinner than those of oysters grown in the intermediate range. My results provide insight into how salinity alters the ability of oysters to induce morphological predation defenses that ultimately impact their survival and future persistence.&nbsp;&nbsp;",1,65,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, our understanding of the underlying assembly processes acting on NIS, as well as the relationship with native species is limited, especially in marine ecosystems. To overcome this knowledge gap we here developed a trait-based approach to assess niche overlap and functional distinctiveness between NIS and native species, applied to benthic invertebrates and coastal fish communities in the Baltic Sea as a case study. Our results show a moderate degree of functional distinctiveness of NIS if compared with the whole species pool, but major differences between NIS and natives in the expression of individual traits, particularly in terms of bioturbation, parental care or territorial behavior. This indicates that NIS may successfully establish by displaying only one or a few singular traits while retaining a certain degree of similarity with native species. Furthermore, we demonstrate pronounced variability in NIS distinctiveness in space, largely explained by different environmental conditions and biotic effects channeled through species richness and evenness across sampling sites. Hence, assembly processes like environmental filtering and limiting similarity may affect the establishment and success of NIS, while their effect and relative importance may be highly context-dependent. Finally, our trait-based approach provides a generic framework applicable to other areas and organisms, to better understand and address biological invasions and their impacts on biodiversity and marine ecosystem functioning at large.&nbsp;",2,69,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, recent theoretical debate and empirical evidence suggests substantial variability in this relationship. Resolution of heterogeneity’s effects requires considering: the various ways to conceptualise and measure heterogeneity; and the potential moderating role of environmental context and organismal group. Using rocky reefs as a test system, we developed a novel framework to organise studies of local-scale heterogeneity into six main facets, synthesising heterogeneity’s effects and evaluating key moderators. Metaregression revealed generally positive saturating responses of richness and abundance, with three-dimensional structures generating the strongest responses of all facets. Community responses were also affected by seasonality and biogeography, with micro- and macroinvertebrate responses strengthening towards the equator. Organismal group was a key moderator; microinvertebrates and fish benefitted the most – and macroinvertebrates the least – from heterogeneity. Heterogeneity also mitigated grazing and enhanced recruitment, helping explain effects on biodiversity. Our results indicate qualitative similarity in heterogeneity relationships across facets and responses, and identify important moderators.

Here, we present insights into the diversity and ecological role of DNA viruses from proglacial streams in Switzerland. Proglacial streams are characterized by extreme environmental conditions, including near-freezing temperatures and ultra-oligotrophy. These conditions select for few but well-adapted bacterial clades, which numerically dominate biofilm communities and occupy niches via microdiversification. We used metagenomic sequencing to reveal a remarkable diverse virome of glacier-fed and tributary streams without glacier influence. Despite the interconnectivity among these different stream types, viral assemblages were significantly coupled to bacterial biofilm communities in the respective streams, highlighting the specificity of phage-bacterial interactions in biofilms. Coupling phage-host predictions with the prediction of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), we identify key functions which are putatively dispersed by phages among members of microdiverse bacterial clades. We found mainly AMGs involved in energy and co-factor metabolisms and notably sulfur metabolism, a key trait in proglacial streams.

The composition of communities can be described using the functional traits of community constituents, and thus trait-based approaches for quantifying community composition represent a powerful strategy for investigating the ecological and evolutionary consequences of non-native species. In high elevation lakes of the Wind River Range (Wyoming, USA), we sampled zooplankton in 33 historically fishless lakes and 55 lakes with introduced trout. For each zooplankton taxon, we measured multiple traits expected to respond to fish predation (body size, size at maturity, reproduction method, fecundity, trophic position, and habitat choice). We found that functional richness, functional dispersion, and functional evenness were decreased by the presence of fish. Beta diversity analysis also showed that lakes with introduced fish are more similar to one another. Our results confirm that the introduction of fish can homogenize lakes, shift the zooplankton community assemblage, and constrain the functional space. Differences in life history traits (size at maturity, fecundity) between fishless lakes and lakes with introduced trout were driven by both interspecific and intraspecific shifts, and their covariation, and by both direct effects of fish predation and by indirect effects of fish presence on the stoichiometry of phytoplankton, which alters the food quality for zooplankton.",0,,6/9/23 8:30,6/9/23 10:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

We show that more fundamentally the null expectation of steady richness over time is wrong even when colonization and extinction happen at equal rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;We first analysed highly curated global river fish time series and found an overall increase in richness.

To understand how much this bias influences richness trends generally, we simulated time series using a neutral model such that no richness trend is expected. Still, these simulated time series showed significant increases of richness over&nbsp;time in contrast to our equilibrium-based expectation because new species established earlier than native species declined towards extinction or detection limit.

Corals in the Galápagos archipelago have experienced severe bleaching during ENSO events and are exposed to a wide range of temperatures throughout the year due to the convergence of multiple oceanographic currents. Previous work determined that Pocillopora corals from warmer northern sites had greater heat and cold tolerances in comparison to corals from the southern islands that experience cooler and more variable temperatures on average. The mechanisms underlying these thermal tolerance patterns are currently unknown. Utilizing quantitative PCR, we quantified symbiont communities in coral colonies from two islands containing comparatively stress-tolerant (Darwin) and stress-sensitive (Isabela) corals to investigate the role of symbiont community in setting thermal tolerance. We found higher proportions of Durusdinium over Cladocopium in the northern site of Darwin relative to the southern site of Isabela. Darwin colonies (n=5) contained a mix of Cladocopium and Durisdinium, whereas all Isabela colonies (n=5) contained 100% Cladocopium.

We are uncertain whether bacteria that do so, the so-called bloomers, have specific functional characteristics or if, instead, they are randomly selected among all copiotrophs. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis with taxa from microcosm experiments where grazer and viral presence was reduced and nutrient availability was increased, factors that induced bacterial blooms. We tested the correlation between experimental growth rates and proportions of functional genes from a total of 203 genomes from isolates, metagenome-assembled genomes and representatives GTDB species which were classified into copiotrophs and oligotrophs according to their codon usage bias. We found that signal transduction mechanisms (especially two-component systems) and transcriptional regulation were the best correlated functional categories, followed by cell motility, ion transport, defense mechanisms and membrane-related functions. Copiotrophic taxa from classes Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Verrucomicrobiae showed comparatively high proportions of genes related to all or some of these categories. In this study we provide insights into the functional characteristics that allow certain copiotrophs to rapidly respond to changes in the environment and, potentially, develop blooms.",12,78,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Seagrass and mangrove DOM, important allochthonous sources in tropical oligotrophic regions, had distinct chemical characteristics compared to unamended seawater, with mangrove substrates containing comparatively more nitrogen and protein-like fluorescent DOM than seagrass. Specific growth rates increased approximately 2-fold in the seagrass and mangrove treatments (1.0 and 0.8 d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) relative to the seawater control (0.4 d<sup>-1</sup>). The biomass of heterotrophic bacteria generally reflected µ changes, reaching maximum values of 16.8 and 17.3 µg C L<sup>-1</sup><sup> </sup>in the seagrass and mangrove treaments, respectively, compared to just 2.6 µg C L<sup>-1</sup><sup> </sup>in seawater. The increase in specific growth rates due to experimental warming followed the metabolic theory of ecology, mostly as a result of enhanced exoenzymatic activity, while cell size decreased as predicted by the temperature-size rule (mean -3% per °C increase). Although the labile nature of the specific seagrass and mangrove DOM leachates was clearly demonstrated, we conclude that Red Sea heterotrophic bacteria will have limited capability to increase their biomass as a consequence of future warming, even in the presence of high loadings of macrophytic DOM.",1,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 1,

The recent discovery of the lytic <em>Autolykiviridae</em> family demonstrated the potential importance of this structural lineage, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the role of this group of marine viruses. Here we report the novel family of temperate phages under the class of <em>Tectiliviricetes</em>, which we propose to name “Asemoviridae” with phage NO16 as a main representative. These phages are widely distributed across geographical regions and isolation sources and found inside the genomes of at least 30 species of Vibrio in addition to the original <em>V. anguillarum</em> isolation host. The interactions between the NO16 phage and its <em>V. anguillarum</em> host were linked to cell density and phage-host ratio. High cell density and low phage predation levels were shown to favour the temperate over the lytic lifestyle for NO16 viruses, and their spontaneous induction rate was highly variable between different <em>V. anguillarum</em> lysogenic strains. NO16 prophages coexist with the <em>V. anguillarum</em> host in a mutualistic interaction by rendering fitness properties to the host, such as increased virulence and biofilm formation through lysogenic conversion, likely contributing to their global distribution.",4,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 1,

However, the main period of cyanobacteria blooms usually starts 2 to 3 months after the termination of the spring bloom, and it is unclear which organisms utilize the excess phosphate during this time. We studied the removal potential of excess phosphate and the effect of temperature on phosphate uptake rate and plankton stoichiometry in an indoor microcosm experiment after the spring bloom in the northern Baltic. The DIN:DIP uptake ratio was 4.6, which is substantially lower than the canonical Redfield ratio 16 and demonstrates the potential of luxury uptake and storage of phosphorus relative to nitrogen. A larger part of the excess phosphate ended up in the particulate pool compared to the dissolved pool, which suggests the potential for phosphorus export out from the surface layer. The growth of <em>Nodularia spumigena</em> was limited by temperature and at the end of the experiment, the total biovolume of the three main bloom-forming diazotrophic cyanobacteria, <em>N. spumigena</em>, <em>Aphanizomenon </em>sp., and<em> Dolichospermum </em>spp<em>.,</em> together accounted for only ca. 5% of the total end biovolume. Our results, therefore, suggest that the contribution of diazotrophic cyanobacteria to the removal of the excess phosphate is small and support previous findings of the importance of small organisms (&lt;10µm) in phosphate uptake during the post-spring bloom period.",3,79,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Without this information, our ability to describe and understand the impact of viruses on their microbial communities have been severely limited. To remedy this gap, we developed a model that can resolve virus-host infection networks in silico. We first collected and digitized from published literature a total of 8,849 lab-verified virus-host interactions (infection or non-infection) at the species level, the most comprehensive host range dataset compiled to date. This data was used to assess the strength of previously-described coevolutionary signals between viruses and their hosts. We demonstrated that, relative to their host(s), viruses have both a tendency to ameliorate their k-mer profiles while remaining AT-rich. We then used this host range data to train a machine learning model that can predict the complete network of virus-host interactions. This is in contrast with recently published models that predict the most likely taxa a virus can infect. Furthermore, our machine learning model has an accuracy of 87% in predicting infection and non-infection at the species level, surpassing both the accuracy and sensitivity of existing prediction models. With this model, we can start predicting virus-host infection networks, characterize those network properties, and describe how they correlate with environmental factors.",5,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 1,

Abnormal urchins harbored elevated relative abundance of <em>Vibrio </em>spp. and an OTU within the Fastidiosibacteraceae across all sites and most tissue types. Conversely, abnormal urchins bore fewer <em>Kistimonas </em>spp. and <em>Propionigenium </em>spp. The relation between the Fastidiosibacteraceae OTU, which may be a ciliate endosymbiont, and the ciliate in abnormal urchins led us to hypothesize that the bacterium may induce a virulent phenotype of the ciliate host, as reported between related bacterial taxa and Paramecium spp.. We inhibited the bacterium through streptomycin treatment and examined it in culture and its virulence by direct challenge to sea urchins. Data indicates that it may induce infectious characteristics, and that treated <em>P. apodigitiformis</em> shows decrease growth rates compared to untreated ciliates.

Intensified stratification due to warming, predicted for the ocean worldwide, will trap nutrients at depth and leave phytoplankton communities at the surface nutrient-limited, which has the potential to drastically alter their photosynthetic efficiency. Nutrient stress effects on photosynthetic efficiency are often assessed with bio-optical approaches such as Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry. However, phytoplankton must first be able to recover from photoinhibition in order to disentangle the effects of light and nutrients on photosynthetic efficiency. In regions like the Northern Gulf of Alaska that experience large fluctuations in light availability at the surface, phytoplankton communities are vulnerable to photoinhibition. These experiments show that&nbsp; low-light acclimation is more effective at eliminating a light history signal from phytoplankton samples than the standard protocol of dark acclimation used in PAM-fluorometry. This is especially important since nutrient enhancement experiments resulted in changes in photosynthetic efficiency of a much smaller magnitude than those due to photoinhibition. In order to use PAM-fluorometry (or other bio-optical) measurements of photosynthetic efficiency as an indicator for nutrient stress, an alternate protocol should be used to allow for recovery from previous light stress.

We want to study how host-virus systems from related geographical regions (space-for-time approach), that are characterized by different temperature and nutrient regimes, are affected by warming and what changes can be observed in regard to infection dynamics, host-virus interactions and carbon acquisition. <em>Ostreococcus</em> sp. host-virus combinations will be subjected to five assay temperatures and we will measure host growth rates and carbon use efficiencies. We expect these traits to show strong responses to temperature, but the effects on host-virus dynamics and viral traits are less easily predictable. We also test whether viral infection can benefit or impede the fitness response under warming or if environmental history of hosts will be the main driver. Host-virus interactions are an emergent crucial component when predicting not only how climate change affects marine ecosystems, but also how marine ecosystems affect climate change.",5,89,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, the visualization of physical interactions between diatoms and their colonizers is still limited. To enhance our understanding of these specific interactions, a <em>Thalassiosira rotula</em> isolate from the North Sea was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser canning microscopy (CLSM) after staining with fluorescently labelled lectins targeting specific glycoconjugates. To investigate colonization patterns and defined interactions with bacteria the axenic isolate was co-cultivated with a natural bacterial community and in two- or three-partner consortia with different bacteria of the <em>Roseobacter </em>group, <em>Gammaproteobacteria</em> and <em>Bacteroidetes</em>. The CLSM analysis of the consortia identified six lectins as very suitable to characterize glycoconjugates of <em>T. rotula</em>. The resulting images show that fucose-containing threads were the dominant glycoconjugates secreted by the <em>T. rotula</em> cells but chitin and other glycoconjugates were also identified. Bacteria attached predominantly to the fucose glycoconjugates. The colonizing bacteria showed various attachment patterns such as adhering to the diatom threads in aggregates only or attaching to both the surfaces and the threads of the diatom. Interestingly the colonization patterns of single bacteria differed strikingly from those of bacterial co-cultures, indicating that interactions between two bacterial species impacted the colonization of this diatom abundant in coastal seas.",6,90,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

We calculated the carbon retention of primary ecosystem based on the dominant species of phytoplankton, which are primary producers, with the monitoring data from aroung the Korean coastal waters from 2014 to 2021 for analyzing the variancy. A total of 48 species of phytoplankton, including 24 species of diatoms, 20 species of dinoflagellates, and 4 species of flagellates, appeared in the coastal area, and their ratio to the total biomass was over 95%. Depending on cell size and shape,the biovolume (μm3) of each species were caculated (Hillebrand et al. (1999)), and the carbon retention per cell (pg cell-1) was calculated by Linacre et al. (2021), and caculated carbon retention was compared with phytoplankton biomass. As a result, the standing stock of phytoplankton has decreased rapidly since 2018 as a result of reduction in the scale of bloom from spring to summer, and decreasing of the biomass of dominant species which affected by the increase of water temperature. In addition, the proportion of dinoflagellates in the total phytoplankton community was increased. When calculating the carbon retention of phytoplankton in coastal waters, the carbon retention of phytoplankton was ranged from 0.09 to 8.74 mg carbon/L, with an average of 1.45 mg carbon/L. In September 2015 and June 2021, the amount of carbon retention was increased due to the bloom of <em>Margalefidinium polykrikoides</em> and <em>Gymnodinium</em> sp., respectively.&nbsp;When comparing the carbon retention by diatoms and dinoflagellates, contribution of dinoflagellates was high in 2014-2015, when a large-scale bloom occurred, the carbon retention was also high due to the increase in biomass of dinoflagellates after 2018, as same with phytoplankton biomass. The changing in community composition following the increase of dinoflagellate proportion by changing of water temperature could be reflected in the carbon retention of primary marine ecosystem.",0,88,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Larger grazers, such as copepods, efficiently handle and ingest even very long chains, whereas some smaller grazers are unable to feed on chains exceeding a few cells in length. Thus, theory predicts that cues from small grazers should induce increased chain lengths, but this remains to be tested. How these smaller grazers influence colony formation has frequently been studied in prymnesiophytes and freshwater green algae, but there has been little focus on diatoms, despite their importance in marine food webs. We exposed three species of chain-forming diatoms to the indirect presence of micrograzers and recorded their response. We find that the effect of grazer presence on chain length varies depending on both the type of grazer and diatom. For example, <em>Skeletonema marinoi</em> increased its chain length when exposed to cues from the heterotrophic dinoflagellate <em>Gyrodinium</em> <em>dominans</em> and the ciliate <em>Euplotes</em> spp. by up to 40%, thus bringing the diatoms outside the prey size spectrum of the grazers. In contrast, <em>Thalassiosira rotula</em> did not respond to cues from <em>G. dominans</em>, but rather employed other defenses. Our results suggest that chain-forming diatoms are able to sense and appropriately respond to fast growing micrograzers, thus contributing to the success of diatoms in marine environments.",0,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Palma,

In marine systems, cyanobacteria are more successful than their eukaryotic counterparts because they survive environmental conditions less tolerated by other phytoplankton groups. Owing at least in part to their important roles in the nitrogen and carbon cycle, cyanobacteria and their physiological responses to environmental drivers are fairly well-studied. However, short-term responses cannot always be directly used to predict long-term responses, but we need to know the latter in order to say with more certainty if and why cyanobacteria are indeed the winners of a warming planet. This study explicitly investigates re-germinated cyanobacteria from different sediment layers (each layer representing different times) in response to increasing temperature using molecular (whole genome sequencing) and trait-based approaches. The comparative whole genome analysis of historic and recent strains of Dolichospermum spp. will test to what extent cyanobacteria have already evolved. Subsequent evolution experiments will instead test the evolutionary potential of cyanobacteria: how fast they evolve, and the traits affected. As temperatures are expected to rise, results from our experiments will then be fitted into cyanobacteria life cycle models in order to predict how cyanobacteria would respond to future temperature changes.",3,84,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Low microzooplankton grazing is considered a key feature underpinning the massive phytoplankton blooms observed during spring and summer.&nbsp; Growth and grazing measurements are, however, scarce and constrained to the surface mixed-layer. Here we present depth-resolved rates of phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing in the euphotic zone (56 profiles) obtained from 2-point dilution experiments (n=336) carried out in the Ross Sea continental shelf, shelf-slope and off-shelf regions during 3 Antarctic summer voyages conducted as part of the New Zealand Ross Sea Research And Monitoring Programme (Ross-RAMP). Phytoplankton growth was higher than grazing in the upper euphotic zone, and decreased with depth, while grazing remained relatively constant vertically and led to net consumption in the lower euphotic zone. Depth-averaged growth and net growth rates (i.e., growth - grazing) tended to be positive and substantially higher in the shelf compared to off-shelf waters, where phytoplankton growth was lower and kept in check by microzooplankton grazing. Pigment-specific analysis of dilution experiments showed that diatoms growth and net growth rates were consistently higher than that of prymnesiophytes across all regions and&nbsp;depths. Understanding the factors that control phytoplankton growth, microzooplankton grazing variability is crucial to predict the effects that projected environmental changes will have on the trophic and biogeochemical functioning of the Ross Sea region pelagic ecosystem.",1,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Palma,

Phytoplankton are a highly diverse set of organisms, with one group, diatoms, particularly important in the food web and in carbon export. Here we investigate what controls the relative abundance of diatoms in the Baffin Bay region. Using sensitivity analysis within a trait-based plankton model, we show how winter nitrate concentration and winter silicic acid concentration are controlling the relative importance of each biogeochemical group in the phytoplankton assemblage. We use a one-dimensional version of the MIT general circulation model coupled to its biogeochemical/ecosystem component. This model is particularly efficient at representing a diversity of phytoplankton functional traits and size classes, and its results are compared to observations at an ice camp for investigating the phytoplankton assemblage. Our study suggests that the absence of nutrient limitation <em>before</em> the bloom prevents a differentiation of the assemblage at this stage. However, numerical experiments varying winter nitrate and winter silicic acid modified the relative contribution of diatoms <em>after</em> the bloom. Hence, a possible departure from the average condition of nutrients following the impacts of climate change in the Arctic would change the relative contribution of diatoms to the phytoplankton assemblage after the bloom; this may have cascading effects on the function of Arctic marine ecosystems.",5,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Palma,

However, information on the transfer of nutrients between the two seasons remains scarce. Here we studied the phytoplankton community composition and how it affects vertical nutrient fluxes in Rappbode Reservoir, a deep, dimictic, clear-water lake in central Germany. We conducted a sampling campaign from November to July spanning one winter circulation and one spring period and collected bi-weekly samples for phytoplankton, water chemistry, and physical variables, and monthly measurements of sedimentation fluxes using sediment traps. Phytoplankton, with special attention to diatoms, was quantitatively investigated. The reservoir mixed from mid-December until stratification onset in mid-April. Cyanobacteria were the most dominant group during mixing with peak biomass in March. The diatom bloom started at the onset of stratification in April and peaked in early June. The most abundant diatom species were <em>Aulacoseira granulata</em>, <em>Tabellaria fenestrata</em>, and <em>Fragilaria spp</em>. The particulate phosphorus content per unit of carbon in the sediment traps peaked in March and April, but the highest vertical phosphorus flux was in May during the diatom bloom. Our results show that winter-spring phytoplankton, particularly diatoms, and cyanobacteria can store substantial amounts of nutrients in the biomass. Moreover, the winter-spring conditions influence the phytoplankton composition, which in turn affects nutrient cycling in lakes.",4,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Palma,

Therefore, photorespiration is largely viewed as unfavorable to primary productivity and widely considered to be a wasteful process. Algal species especially belonging to cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and green algae would be CO<sub>2</sub> limited under current levels, with nearly 50% of the carbon and energy being lost to photorespiration. Carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) helps alleviate this CO<sub>2</sub> limitation by concentrating CO<sub>2</sub> near RUBISCO enzyme, thereby playing a significant role in net CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. However, the processes activating CCM remains a mystery, with certain species repressing their CCM under high CO<sub>2</sub> levels, while some maintain CCM activity. Photorespiration mutants depend on high CO<sub>2</sub> to grow phototrophically, suggesting a link between photorespiration and CCM. Our data shows that metabolic inhibition of photorespiration results in reduced growth amongst species of cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and green algae, but not diatoms. Furthermore, addition of hydroxypyruvate to photorespiration mutants restarted their growth and phototrophic viability. Further physiological and gene expression studies are underway to decipher the role of the photorespiration pathway in activating CCM and how taxa dependent variation in these processes will affect the phytoplankton community composition in a changing world.",2,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Palma,

DHM was more likely among larger (&gt; 0.9 mm) calanoids, cyclopoids, <em>Daphnia</em>, and <em>Diaphanosoma </em>than in smaller organisms.

Rates of silicon uptake in Rhizaria were variable among taxa, demonstrating that certain Rhizaria groups have a larger impact than others to overall silicon cycling in NE Pacific waters. &nbsp;The ultimate goal of this work is to help constrain the contributions of siliceous plankton to the marine silicon cycle by comparing siliceous biomass and silicon use in diatoms with the poorly-known siliceous Rhizaria.",4,95,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

This migration may be the largest migration on earth by mass and a primary source of biologically generated turbulence. Thus, this migration potentially impacts climate modeling, solute mixing, and gas exchange. However, estimates of the magnitude of mixing from field and laboratory measurements span several orders of magnitude. Using brine shrimp (artemia salina) as a model organism, we leverage positive phototaxis to induce synchronized vertical migration and capture the trajectories of individual swimmers using a scanning laser sheet and high-speed camera.

The reason for the lack of studies is both the difficulty of identifying parasitized hosts non-destructively, and the inability to maintain experimental infection systems. We have relatively easy field access to a specific parasite, of unknown taxonomy. The parasite spreads throughout the body of the host as root-like structures filled with spores, turning the transparent host orange and manipulating it to the surface. This is thought to increase trophic transmission to the next host. We examined the parasite-host association and specifically targeted the pigmentation and costs in terms of metabolism. We found that the orange pigmentation is due to a combination of astaxanthin (red) and β-carotene (yellow), associated with the host and parasite, respectively. Ultrastructure revealed parasitic cells attached to lipid structures in the hemocoel, suggesting specialization towards lipid-rich copepods, like <em>Calanus</em>. Parasitized hosts had higher oxygen consumption per unit biomass. Stable isotope analysis revealed that parasitized copepods had depleted lipid resources. The parasite was originally described as <em>Ichthyophonus</em>, a group of fish-infecting parasites. Ultrastructure and Sanger-sequencing of partial SSU, ITS and LSU found no evidence of a relationship with <em>Ichthyophonus</em>, and the sequences did not match any other groups in GenBank.",2,93,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Temperature, UV exposure, resources, predators, and competitors all can vary vertically, and considerable research has focused on how these factors influence migration patterns. In addition, migrating zooplankton likely move between areas of lower and higher exposure to parasites. Moreover, hosts experience daily fluctuations in susceptibility to parasites based on factors such as timing of molting, circadian melatonin levels, and fluctuating immune responses. The answer to the question of how diel dynamics help or hinder the parasite must consider how migration influences encounter rate of host and parasite, the thermal ecology of both host and parasite, diel fluctuations in host immunity, and how migrations may change interactions with other species (e.g., predators and competitors) that may alter disease dynamics. In a series of laboratory experiments with the host&nbsp;<em>Daphnia dentifera</em>&nbsp;and the fungal pathogen&nbsp;<em>Metschnikowia bicuspidata,&nbsp;</em>we considered how swimming behavior, level of melatonin exposure, temperature, and timing of host molting may influence disease.

This progress of complexity is like the one entomologist experienced (e.g., Gore et al 1977). Therefore, we analyzed their methodology and found an instrument that sets up chemical landscapes for observing animals’ reaction to volatile chemicals (Vet et al 1983). We adapted the design of Vet et al (1983) and modified it to work in water. Basically, an arena of 70 mL (1 cm deep) is hydrodynamical subdivided in four sections each receiving water at one end and discharging it in the center of the arena. NIR illumination and NIR sensitive camera allows observation of the animal’s behavior. By adding dissolved substances to one or more sections we can see avoidance of preference of sections. We can also register behavior before the addition or behavior after switching of the chemical’s supply.

For example, in&nbsp;the coastal Southern North Sea (SNS), observed chlorophyll concentrations increased in spite of a significant reduction in nutrient loads. Most models so far failed to reproduce this trend because they assume a bottom-up control of ecosystem dynamics. Here, we use a coupled model system (MOSSCO-GETM-MAECS) with a realistic representation of turbidity in near-coast waters. High turbidity not only impedes autotrophic growth due to light limitation but also creates a refuge for juvenile fish so that carnivorous grazing on zooplankton increases towards the coast. We validate long-term simulations of the SNS against satellite and in-situ observations, and show that climate warming has intensified temperature-dependent carnivory, which through reduced herbivory positively affects net phytoplankton growth. The simulated long-term change in coastal carnivory matches well an observed increase in juvenile fish biomass.

Subsidies of material and energy from donor ecosystems can significantly influence the structure and dynamics of recipient communities and food webs. The largest observed cross-ecosystem fluxes are from marine to terrestrial systems, consist of exported primary production, and are driven by currents and tides. An exceptional example is the substantial subsidy of organic matter exported by highly productive nearshore kelp forests to sandy beaches. The wrack subsidies exported from kelp forests to beaches support their biodiversity and numerous ecosystem functions as well as fuel highly productive beach food webs. Kelp wrack inputs to beaches are highly dynamic, but the relative spatial scale at which this connectivity occurs is largely unknown. Here, we use local (100 m) to regional (100 km) scale measurements of kelp wrack inputs along with nearshore kelp supply, via Landsat-derived kelp canopy biomass estimates, to determine the scale at which connectivity between beaches and kelp forests is maximized. Our results indicated that connectivity is maximized at scales of less than 10 km. Further, these relationships are strongest in winter and weakest in summer. In addition, the form of kelp (wrack vs. whole plants) is an important factor in determining the spatial scale of connectivity with kelp forests. Elucidating the fine-scale variability in ecosystem subsidies will be critical as ecosystem connectivity is weakened through climate change and anthropogenic development.",1,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Menorca B,

Black mangroves are viviparous, with propagules germinating on the parent tree followed by a floating dispersal stage. Once the propagules reach a suitable environment, the seed will take root. Many abiotic factors may influence the successful establishment of propagules in the field, and greenhouse studies are one tool to investigate the importance of various abiotic conditions. However, the methods for establishing seedlings in order to conduct effective greenhouse studies are not well standardized. The purpose of this research was to understand mangrove seedling response to different greenhouse conditions, including distinct substrates and watering regimes. Seedlings were collected from the field and transplanted into four different substrate conditions: sand, nutrient-amended sand, a mixture of sand and potting soil, and potting soil. As for the watering conditions used, there were non-flooded conditions and semi-flooded conditions. Over the course of three weeks, a rapid decline of seedling health, as measured with an index of leaf color, was observed across all experimental treatments. However, the sand-only substrate (without&nbsp; nutrient or potting soil amendments) had the least dramatic decline, suggesting that the sand medium, which was most similar to the substrate from the field, was the most ideal out of the four. There were smaller differences among watering regimes,&nbsp; where a decline was seen for the non-flooded seedlings after two weeks, and the flooded conditions remained more stable. The rapid overall seedling decline suggests transplant shock, indicating that effective greenhouse studies should germinate seeds in pots rather than collecting seedlings directly from the field.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;",1,108,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Thus, understanding spatial patterns of infection and associated factors that may promote outbreaks is increasingly important in the Anthropocene. Coral in the genus<em> Porites</em> respond to infection by forming raised pink polyps. In July of 2016 and 2021, we observed an outbreak of pink lesions (PL) on coral in the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia. We quantified spatial patterns in prevalence and dispersion within two bays with developed watersheds, hypothesizing prevalence (% infected per site) and dispersion (pattern on individual colonies) would be highest within the impacted bays. Also quantified dispersion at a high prevalence site using Mean to Variance Ratio. Found prevalence was highest in the bays. At low and medium prevalence sites in 2016, 15-20% of colonies had PL compared to 11% in 2021, while high prevalence sites exceeded 90% infected in both years. Overall, aggregation decreased with prevalence, with the low prevalence site highly clustered and the high prevalence site randomly dispersed. Thus, it is unlikely for a colony to be heavily infected unless surrounded by infected colonies. At one impacted site, prevalence was higher in 2021 than in 2016, which could infer that human development has worsened conditions in that area or outbreak cycles can be site dependent.

However, knowledge of their effects on the timing and magnitude of spring phytoplankton bloom (SPB) remains limited. Here, based on decadal satellite data (2003–2020), we examine the climatological relationship between the Shandong coastal front (SCF) and SPB in the Yellow Sea. The results show that the onset of SPB occurs either in March (∼56% of the seasons examined) or in April (44%). The peak of SPB most often occurs in April (∼56% of the seasons examined) or is advanced to March (16%) or delayed to May (28%), and that the peak ranges from 1.04 to 2.54 mg Chl-<em>a</em>&nbsp;m<sup>−3</sup>. The onset of SPB matches with lower turbulence, particularly when the rate of generation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE<sub>RT</sub>) reaches zero. A higher magnitude of bloom is associated with a greater change in front and a lower TKE<sub>RT</sub>. The&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;observations along the SCF transects in the Yellow Sea indicate that weakened SCF in spring associated with a shallower mixing layer enhances the transport of nutrients from the coastal to the shelf waters. Weakened frontal structure and atmospheric forcing in spring can further increase the water stability and decrease turbulence in the upper waters. The variation in hydrodynamic conditions allows shelf phytoplankton to stay longer in the upper waters with sufficient light and nutrients and consequently generate a Chl-<em>a</em>&nbsp;peak.

During this episode, several lava flows reached the coast, creating two lava deltas with a total surface area of about 50 hectares, and reaching depths of over 100 meters in some points. In this study, we have followed the primary colonization and early succession of fishes, invertebrates and macroalgae in these new and morphologically complex intertidal and shallow subtidal environments. In general, the new lava deltas are still significantly different than the control areas, but community response has been different in the three groups and two environments (intertidal and subtidal) studied in terms of species richness and abundances. Fishes rapidly colonized the new areas, and have similar richness and abundances to the control zones after only seven months of monitoring. Invertebrates have shown a continuous increase in abundance and richness, still lower than in the control areas, and at different rates in both intertidal and subtidal. Macroalgae quickly covered almost 100% of the available substrate in the intertidal, with a distinctly lower cover in the subtidal, and richness has been in continuous fluctuation marked by the succession of seasonal species.",4,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Menorca B,

The present work characterizes the texture and composition of the sediment accumulated in the fairy circles and compares it with other nearby sub-environments from the samplings carried out in two locations in Mallorca, one from Menorca, and one from Girona. The results describe differences in the size of the sediment and in the composition between the interior and the margins of the fairy circles, as well as with respect to the interior of the meadow or the free accumulations of sand close to the fairy circle. As well as a differentiated spatial distribution of the sedimentary facies.

Using harmonic analysis, a method that fits sine and cosine functions to seasonally varying data, this project seeks to investigate the differences in harmonic elements (date and value of minimum/maximum and seasonal amplitude) on a spatial and temporal scale, specifically comparing subsampled short term high frequency (4-6 years of 15 minute resolution) to long term low frequency (30 years of quarterly sampled resolution) sites. At high frequency sites, error variability between successive years of simulated quarterly sampling are compared to full model values using novel methods of logarithmic regression. This information allows us to understand baseline seasonal patterns, and investigate deviations of those through anomalies. Diurnal anomalies are examined in both magnitude and directional changes due to weather factors based on a storm and seasonal scale. These correlations can inform us of potential disturbances in water quality that may become more severe and/or frequent as the amount and severity of storms and flooding increase due to global warming and sea level rise.

Amino sugars are common constituents on the cell surface of marine plankton. Their ability to interact with mucus lectins suggests they may have a role in food capture and selection in suspension feeders. We studied <em>in situ</em> modulation of capture efficiency of natural seston groups over several seasons in two groups of suspension feeders: mussels (<em>Mytilus edulis </em>and <em>Geukensia demissa</em>) and ascidians (<em>Ciona intestinalis</em> and <em>Styela clava</em>). In the laboratory, the same suspension feeders species were exposed to 0.3 -, 0.5 - and 1-µm polystyrene spheres uncoated or coated with the nonionic surfactant Poloxamer 188 (Pol) or the neoglycoprotein galactosamine-BSA (Gal). In most cases, pico-cyanobacteria were captured at a higher efficiency than larger nano-eukaryotic algae.

Identifying factors that govern the fluctuation and longevity of mussel populations is important for the management of the fishery, setting conservation targets, and coastal restoration purposes. Since 1993, annual blue mussel stock surveys have been carried out in the Limfjorden, Denmark. We used the stock survey data combined with electronic monitoring fishing data and a Mechanistic Model for Limfjorden, providing environmental data, to investigate the longevity of subtidal mussel beds. Multiple factors were found to affect the longevity of subtidal mussel beds in Limfjorden. Our study reveals that predation by starfish, fishing activities, and consecutive days of oxygen depletion are significant factors, negatively impacting bed stability. Conversely, increased biomass and the presence of multiple cohorts demonstrate stabilizing effects on mussel beds. These analyses can help inform environmental, conservation, and fisheries managers on the long-term trends of population dynamics and factors contributing to the variability in population stability in the context of declining stocks.",10,106,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

These changes affect the availability of organic matter from various marine or terrestrial origins that form the base of coastal lagoon food webs. The consequences to nearshore food webs for fish are manifested through shifts in their species composition, abundance, growth, and reproduction. Such adjustments can differ regionally or by species. Here, we aim to determine trophic resource use in multiple marine and diadromous fish species from several Arctic Beaufort Sea coastal lagoons using short and long time-scale markers of diet. First, a short-term diet snapshot was determined from stomach contents of Arctic fishes (Arctic cod, saffron cod, Arctic cisco, least cisco, fourhorn sculpin, Dolly Varden) from three regions (Utqiaġvik, Prudhoe Bay, Kaktovik). Analysis of diet composition revealed differences among species and by region. Secondly, trophic niche width, trophic position, and ultimate carbon sources of these six fish species at longer time scales (months) were determined by&nbsp;bulk carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic analysis&nbsp;and compound-specific amino acid carbon stable isotope analysis. Long-term markers indicated that marine residents assimilated carbon at higher tropic levels with strong connections to marine primary producers. Conversely, diadromous species feed at lower trophic levels and source carbon from a wider variety of organic matter sources. Our findings provide a better understanding of the current trophic resource for fish species that are important ecologically and for local subsistence. This work demonstrates the diversity of carbon sources that are seasonally available to sustain coastal fish populations in the context of anticipated ecosystem disruptions associated with climate warming.",3,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Menorca B,

These result from coupled local trophic dynamics, dispersal processes, resource availability, and abiotic factors ruled by the landscape matrix, which also determines the spatial connectivity for dispersal and resource fluxes. This is particularly the case for river networks, which exhibit universal spatial structures that are linked to species and metacommunity processes. Here, using a mechanistic model of spatially connected food webs integrating biological and hydrological aspects, we investigate how food-web properties vary in space. We then contrast our predictions with several null models, where spatial structure or trophic interactions of the spatial food-web model are relaxed. We find that species richness is highest in areas where local nutrient load is maximal. Species richness is positively associated with link density, modularity and omnivory, and negatively with connectance, nestedness and niche overlap. However, for connectance and omnivory, stochasticity of trophic interactions is a stronger predictor than spatial variables. Relationships between species richness and food-web metrics do not hold in null models, and are hence the outcome of river-specific coupled biological and hydrological processes. Our model generates realistic patterns of species richness and food-web properties, shows that no universal food-web patterns emerge from the riverine landscape structure, and paves the way for future applications investigating riverine metacommunity dynamics.",2,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza B,

Previous attempts on this direction include the work of Mistr and Bercovici, in which they successfully describe the formation of parallel stripes. Some other authors have proposed a model based on the chemistry of the aragonite synthesis combined with diffusion. However, although these works reproduce some of the observed patterns in nature, they do not provide a whole description of the system and they do not include they key role of hydrodynamics in reef shaping. We propose a new model to describe coral reefs by considering four variables: alive coral tissue P, dissolved nutrients in ocean water N, amount of accumulated aragonite A and the saturation state of aragonite in water Ω. The amount of accumulated aragonite A is easily converted into the height the reef has reached at time t and we consider that at every moment live corals are settled over this hard rock structure or over the sea floor if there is no hard rock. These four variables interact following a reaction-diffusion model (plus an advective term for water flux) that includes the basic ecological, physical and geological interactions in a reef. After calibrating the parameters of the model based on real data and some reasonable assumptions, we have started to study the model’s behavior, obtaining results that resemble the shape of different types of reefs.",4,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza B,

Capable of exerting top-down forces on Bay trophic webs, they pose a threat to several fisheries-significant species, including the blue crab and fishes such as menhaden and shad. This project focuses on the use of a dynamic mass-balanced ecosystem modeling software, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE), supplemented with NOAA Fisheries data, to simulate the effects that blue catfish have on the trophic systems of the Bay over time and the interactions between fisheries and ecosystems. EwE allows for the exploration of policy options such as catch quotas, and marine protected areas to optimize for fishery health and economic stability. By exploring policy options for economically incentivizing the capture of blue catfish by recreational and commercial fisheries, the primary objective of reducing the population to a sustainable level can be reasonably accomplished. If the invasive blue catfish population can be reliably controlled through EwE-informed management strategies, then blue crab populations will increase, at least in principle. By extension, preliminary data suggests that patterns relevant to the interaction between blue catfish and blue crabs will be applicable to future, more complex interactions involving menhaden and shad, as well as other key members of Chesapeake Bay food web",0,113,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Recent work has improved estimation of denitrification from diel dinitrogen (N2) flux, but questions remain about the ability of N2 flux modeling to accurately quantify N2 fixation relative to other N2 removal processes like ebullition. Using N2 and O2 flux, we tested feedbacks between C and N cycling in a stream mesocosm experiment. We treated 12 mesocosms with N:P ranging from 2 to 200, inoculating all with a mix of N fixing and denitrifying microbes. We hypothesized that diel N2 fluxes would be sensitive to reactive N concentration and N:P, as nutrient availability promotes the engagement of different energetic pathways. Preliminary results show evidence for denitrification dominating N2:Ar flux in high N:P mesocosms, and N fixation dominating N2:Ar flux in low N:P mesocosms. We will use cluster analysis to determine if different N:P produced distinct diel gas flux patterns. Denitrification and N fixation will be quantified using N2 flux modeling, and respiration and primary production estimated with two-station metabolism modeling. We will explore the most important factors controlling C and N cycling rates using machine learning. Our results confirm that N2 flux modeling provides a promising framework for investigating linked C and N cycling, but reliable estimation of N process rates requires more accurate partitioning of N2 removal processes.",1,112,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Overfishing and fish stock depletion have been driven largely by these subsidies. To better understand the impact of fishery subsidies, a theoretical model of a monospecific fishery with 7 different life stages of the fishery was created, which presented three levels of subsidies: 10%, 20%, and 30%. We also modeled the probability of redirecting subsidies towards no-take marine protected areas as a means of increasing biomass and average fish size. The results revealed that subsidies intended to reduce fishing costs artificially inflated profits and delayed the point of ""zero profits"" up to 8 years, creating a mismatch in which maximum sustainable yield fishing is ineffective. The delay resulted in worse stock biomass over time, fewer accumulated profits for fishermen, and a less favorable scenario for implementing measures to reduce fishing effort or create a no-take marine reserve. Further, the model explains that reducing harmful fishery subsidies and redirecting them towards sustainable practices led to a sustainable fishery over time and increased profits for fishermen. In summary, this theoretical work has clarified the different effects of varying and type of subsidies on fish stocks and sustained fishing practices. It emphasizes the importance of redirecting subsidies towards sustainable practices to achieve a positive feedback loop that supports both the fishing sector and the environment.",5,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza B,

Water quality across the world has declined in the last decades due to anthropogenic activities causing eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems as the result of excessive nutrient inputs. The increase of nutrient concentrations in aquatic ecosystems promotes phytoplankton development. This phenomenon can trigger a shift of&nbsp;water systems from a clear stable state to a turbid stable state deteriorating the ecological quality. Lakes and reservoirs play an important role by providing ecosystem services which are essential for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Therefore, it is important to mitigate the impact of global changes on freshwater ecosystems to improve or protect lake, reservoir ecosystems states supplying crucial ecosystem services.

These processes are especially important where a large gradient in water clarity is present.&nbsp;The GBR region is characterised by highly seasonal variable freshwater input from several rivers, which can lead to large sediment and nutrient discharge near the coast, strongly affecting the water optical properties. In this study, we use a coupled hydrodynamical-optical-biogeochemical ocean model (eReefs 4 km configuration) to investigate the feedback between phytoplankton heat absorption and the ocean dynamics in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region. The optical model calculates heat absorption based on the absorption and scattering of 4 phytoplakton types, coloured-dissolved organic matter and 6 sediment fractions, and as a function of solar zenith angle. Here, we compare two simulations: one with a fixed heat absorption coefficient and one with a spatially and temporally variable one influenced by water quality. Our preliminary results show that heat absorption due to phytoplankton and sediment distribution is stronger near the coastal&nbsp;region, especially during the wet season and episodic rainfall events. Considering the spatial variability of heat absorption due to phytoplankton and suspended sediment concentrations can improve modelling the vertical distribution of heat compared to a spatially constant heat absorption coefficient. Higher SST and lower subsurface temperature can develop in presence of a large concentration of optically absorbing material at surface.

The persistent lack in diversity and gender equality amongst the recipients of academic awards and recognitions such as scientific prizes and medals is widely recognised. It is not only still very rare for women to receive the highest research awards (representing for instance only 3% of the Nobel laureates, including only one woman of colour) but female scientists are also severely underrepresented as recipients of the awards, prizes, and medals of many of our scientific societies. The increasing efforts of prize awarding academic institutions and societies, aiming for award distributions to be more representative of the diversity of our scientific community, start with supporting and stimulating inclusivity and broad recognition of the diversity of talent from the nomination stage. Given the continued lack in female winners of academic awards and prizes, the question arises what role the currently existing titles and names of the existing awards, prizes and medals of scientific societies, and the historical legacy of their previous recipients may play for the identification of potential nominations and whether they qualify to inspire more diverse nominations and prize awards.&nbsp; &nbsp; This analysis therefore examines the origin and backgrounds of the names given to ~300 academic awards of the major scientific societies (including at ASLO). It compares award names to the history of the recipients of the respective awards. The results of our analysis reveal an astonishing dominance of awards that are named after male scientists and recognise their contributions to their respective research areas. Less than 10% of all society awards were named after women, with almost all awards named after female scientist only being established in the last two years. It therefore must be questioned if such lack of recognition qualifies to inspire nominations for awards that reflect the diversity of achievements (and achievers) in our scientific communities. In fact, for the analysed awards, women were persistently under-represented as recipients, with on average ~15% of society prizes and medals awarded to female scientists, including awards that have been running for 40 years without a single female recipient. Not different to other scientific fields, women were slightly better represented in service awards and the early career awards of at least some of the societies. An analysis of the more recent history of prizes and medals awarded since the year 2000 reveals a diverse picture with clear differences in the progress towards more equality and diversity between different research communities and societies.&nbsp; &nbsp; This leaves the question how to deal with that substantial legacy of gender bias and unequal representation of talent in the naming of awards as well as their recipients.

Conflicts are often avoided and left to fester, causing further deepening of conflicts to become underlying or deep-rooted over time, making it increasingly difficult to address. In other circumstances, conflict management is addressed head-on, through top-down municipal, regional, federal, and cross-boundary regulations and agreements. In this case, enforcement can be challenged by lack of resources and will, or buy-in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we argue that rather than avoiding, or addressing water-related conflicts solely through top-down regulation and arms-length conflict analyses, new conflict resolution theory provides a novel approach to improve buy-in and adherence to aquatic conservation initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, we argue that engaging “middle-influencers” in the conflict analysis itself offers a unique opportunity to address conservation conflicts and demonstrate how this new strategy can be applied using a case study of a water-stressed region of Canada. We entreat social and natural scientists to collaborate to adapt, iterate, and refine conflict resolution theory to find sustainable solutions to water-related conflicts.",8,116,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

We contend that with each dataset, there is an implicit, moralizing story that justifies its collection. By making these implicit stories explicit to students (i.e. the story challenge), they are more prepared to understand the meaning and applicability of the data collected. This is because students (and all humans) are emotive reasoners first, and technical reasoners second. This presentation introduces a pedagogy focusing on the interrelationship of the technical and story challenges when communicating ocean science topics.

What once drove children to become todays’ marine scientists were the wonder and curiosity that the ocean and its creatures could elicit: the spectacle of ocean life undoubtfully creates a magic “connectedness” that amazes and binds. The feelings arising from a pristine sea enable the awareness that the ocean soothes the eyes and the soul and heals, positively reconnecting humans to nature in the “one-health” perspective. In recent experiences we examined children’s “good” bond to nature through questionnaires, and their engagement in the quest for plastic trash, aimed at sparking kids’ natural curiosity and exploration desire. We humans are better able to protect what we care for: the relationship with nature fosters care and understanding, which should be encouraged from an early age to recreate the “connectedness” fundamental to rebuild respect, love and commitment for the ocean that we want and need.",0,127,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Concurrently, publicity surrounding poor water quality in UK inland and coastal waters is escalating, with swimmers often leading environmental campaigns for water quality improvements. Balancing the potential health benefits versus the environmental risks of wild swimming is essential to help (potential) swimmers make informed decisions. In this interdisciplinary Arts and Humanities Research Council project, we conducted a survey of over 2000 low income households in the UK and found that water quality was the top barrier to engagement with outdoor swimming, ranking above other water safety concerns. We identified gaps in information provision to UK swimmers and found that, in contrast to coastal waters, most inland waters (lakes, ponds, rivers) lacked basic water quality information because only a handful are “designated” swim sites which must legally be monitored. Swimmers were often reliant on swim groups and personal knowledge to help assess water safety. The <em>Bloomin’ algae</em> app can help to educate swimmers, but there are no user-friendly methods or kits suitable for rapid detection of the most prevalent water quality risks including cyanobacterial toxins and bacterial coliforms. Therefore, we developed artwork and messaging on environmental and safety risks that can be used to empower swimmers to make realistic risk assessments for deciding when and where to swim.",2,128,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

When applying management strategies, a lack of information can lead to the alteration of natural systems with an important role on coastal protection, bringing the need of new mitigation, monitoring and/or adaptation projects. However, reaching solutions agreed upon by the entire community can be challenging. Cala Millor (Balearic Islands, Spain) is an example of a transformed ecosystem where the urbanization of the land has led to the modification of a dune system and the artificialization and consequent erosion of a beach system, leaving buildings exposed to coastal flooding. This risk affects not only the environment, but also the entire settled population, including two municipalities, hotels, schools and associations for the elderly, among others. The ‘LIFE AdaptCalaMillor’ project arises from the growing concern and the need to minimize the risks associated with sea level rise and coastal flooding. In this work, a multi-level governance perspective with a participatory approach is proposed. The Think-Reason-Understand-Share-Test (TRUST) method aims to take into account the opinion of representatives from each sector through communication, listening and involvement. In this way, people's input is sought to achieve a balanced interaction and a common feeling, eliminating gaps and leading the project to successful strategies for facing the effects of climate change in Cala Millor.",4,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Portixol 2,

However, they are increasingly threatened by nutrient-enrichment driven by anthropogenic activities. Decrease in number of traps in aquatic carnivorous plants <em>Utricularia</em> spp. (bladderworts) suggested the shift from carnivory to autotrophy (N<sub>prey</sub>) when wetland nutrient became available. Thus, N<sub>prey</sub> in bladderworts could be a potential bioindicator for wetland degradation. However, conventional stable isotope mixing model (RPM) failed to give reasonable N<sub>prey </sub>estimations. Here, we developed two new models (FSM1 and FSM2) to address the association between bladderwort N<sub>prey</sub> and wetland nutrient availabilities. The nitrogen (N) stable isotopes composition (<sup>15</sup>N) of bladderworts and N sources were analyzed across 11 ponds in NSW, Australia, and used to calculate N<sub>prey</sub> in RPM, FSM1 and FSM2, respectively. Trends between N<sub>prey</sub> estimates and environmental nutrient concentrations were tested. <sup>15</sup>N of bladderworts ranged from 1.32&nbsp;to 7.97. FSM2 significantly improved the estimation of Nprey range (0.40 to 1.1), compared to RPM and FSM1.

Therefore, the study of MSCs naturally bridges a wide range of disciplines, from molecular ecology, through oceanography, up to Earth System modelling. In 2022, a new SCOR Working Group named DMS-PRO was created to address knowledge gaps in MSC research by (i) compiling an open-access database of MSC cycling rates; (ii) publishing standardized operating practices for the determination of MSC cycling rates; and (iii) providing guidance to data users, e.g. modelers. DMS-PRO nucleates 20 researchers from 14 countries in Asia, North and South America, Oceania, and Europe; including 6 members from low- and upper-middle income countries and 6 early-career researchers. Forming a group with a balanced geographic spread was challenging because researchers focusing in this area of study are overwhelmingly associated to institutions based in developed countries. To reduce this imbalance, an overarching aspiration of DMS-PRO is to stimulate research, build capacity, and establish an international, multidisciplinary community of practice on the oceanic cycle of MSCs that can share knowledge and skills with the broader oceanographic and Earth system science communities. In this presentation we will briefly introduce DMS-PRO, share the lessons learned during the initial phase of the project, and outline our plans for achieving the group’s objectives.",5,133,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Though well-studied in planktonic algae, we have a limited understanding of nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry in benthic cyanobacteria. As management efforts to address harmful algal blooms often focus on reducing nutrient loading to waterbodies, we must acknowledge that some cyanobacteria proliferate, in part, due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into a bioavailable form. Diazotrophic benthic cyanobacteria therefore present an opportune case to study these dynamics as they may receive a higher proportion of their nutrients from the sediment and can fix N2 as needed. The objective of this study is to quantify nitrogen uptake by benthic cyanobacteria across a N:P gradient. This work will apply a stable isotope tracer method (15N2) to short-term sediment core experiments using cores collected from farm ponds in New South Wales, Australia, that differ in their surrounding land uses (ie. forest-, agriculture-, or urban-dominant). The ratio of N:P in pond sediment is expected to vary across this land use gradient due to differences in anthropogenic influence and associated nutrient loading. Total amounts and rates of nitrogen uptake will be statistically compared across incubations of different N:P ratios, and the benthic algal community will be monitored for changes in composition during each experiment. This work will enhance our understanding of nitrogen uptake by diazotrophic benthic cyanobacteria and how it changes with nutrient availability in freshwater systems.",6,138,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In addition to reduction of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, accelerated CO<sub>2</sub> removal (CDR) is also needed to limit global warming to 2<sup>o</sup>C above the pre-industrial level. The ocean is the largest active carbon pool, and it has a huge potential for removing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Here we report the effects of aluminum (Al) on marine carbon sinks and the possibility of Al fertilization as an ocean-based CDR. Our laboratory and field studies show that Al addition generally enhances carbon fixation by marine phytoplankton such as marine diatoms and nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, etc., by facilitating the use of dissolved organic phosphorus, iron (Fe), and dinitrogen. Moreover, Al may preserve organic carbon from decay and would facilitate the export of the fixed carbon to ocean depths and its sequestration there. We estimate that addition of Al at oceanic relevant levels would lead to 1 to 3 orders of magnitude increases in diatom POC exported to 1000 m in depth. In addition, increases of Al in the range from 20 to 200 nM in the upper ocean might have occurred due to the high dust deposition over the world ocean in glacial times. The Antarctic ice core records show that the emergence of glacial climates was closely linked to high input of dust Al and Fe over the past 800,000 years. Therefore, we built on the Iron Hypothesis to propose the Iron-Aluminum Hypothesis to highlight the importance of Al in carbon fixation, export, and sequestration in the ocean, and thus climate change. Overall, we propose that ocean Al fertilization could be a potential CDR strategy used alone or together with other CDRs such as ocean Fe fertilization, artificial upwelling, and alkalinity enhancement to alleviate global warming.",3,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Menorca A,

Our synthesis estimated that fish contribute an average of about 16.1 percent to total carbon flux out of the euphotic zone but with high uncertainty (standard deviation of 13 percent). Using the mean value of model-generated global carbon flux estimates, we estimated an annual average fish-specific flux of 1.5 Pg C per year, similar to rates previously determined globally for zooplankton. We attributed the high variability in fish flux estimations to significant methodological variations and observational gaps and challenges in our present knowledge. We recommended methodological standards and research to decrease uncertainty, increase our confidence in fish carbon flux estimation, and enable identification of controlling factors to account for spatial and temporal variability. This review, along with other recent research, has fostered an emerging research direction in ocean biological carbon sink and has spurred international discussions to address the effect of fishing on potential carbon sequestration, mitigation and policy considerations, and potential repercussions on socioeconomics.

The upward trend in HRMS analysis of DOM presents challenges in data comparison and interpretation among laboratories operating instruments with differing performance and user operating conditions. It is therefore essential that the community establishes metric ranges and compositional trends for data comparison with reference samples so that data can be robustly compared among research groups. At the ASLO conference in Victoria, 2018, a small group of aquatic scientists working with mass spectrometry decided to address this need by initiating an international ring trial, in which the same four samples from the International Humic Substances Society would be analysed by as many laboratories as possible, in order to determine instrument variability, publish benchmark metric values for ongoing use,&nbsp;and reduce scientific and communication barriers. The laboratory comparison was a great success – 16 laboratories with 17 commercially purchased instruments participated, and analysed the samples in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes. Instrument variability was rather high in terms of the mass window (the range of masses) that they were tuned to, but largely garnered the same information from the four samples, because DOM has so many repeating patterns over the whole mass range. About 1000 common ions were found in each mode for each sample, and the detection of these can be used for establishing and testing new methods.

However, environmental justice (EJ) studies on freshwater ecosystems are few and mostly at the local scale, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient spatial and temporal data. In fact, it is not even known whether current water quality monitoring is adequate to understand national-scale water quality in an EJ context. To fill this knowledge gap, we quantified the relationship between community demographics near lakes and lake water quality monitoring. We used two large publicly-available datasets for the conterminous U.S., one with the frequency and location of lake water quality samples (LAGOS-US) and the other containing racial and ethnic population data (U.S. Census). Using water clarity measures, we found that lakes in communities of color and Hispanic communities were both about 3 times less likely to be monitored than lakes in White and non-Hispanic communities, and 7 and 19 times (respectively) less likely to have long-term monitoring data (≥ 15 years) compared to White and non-Hispanic lakes. Widespread inequity in lake monitoring can leave marginalized communities near lakes vulnerable to environmental hazards when those lakes are not regularly monitored for early detection of negative environmental outcomes. It is not enough to expand freshwater monitoring; programs must consider human population demographics in their sampling design to achieve management outcomes that are equitable for communities of all racial and ethnic compositions.",3,,6/5/23 10:30,6/5/23 12:00,Sala Menorca A,

In April 2018, scientists met to define the microbial ecosystem services that should be considered when assessing potential impacts of deep-sea mining. We described potential major losses of microbial ecosystem services at active hydrothermal vents, and major ecosystem service degradation at inactive massive sulfide deposits without extensive mitigation efforts. Assessment of impacts to microbial ecosystem services at seamounts with ferromanganese crusts is too poorly understood to be definitive.

Methane production in the oxic, mixed surface layer of aquatic bodies increases CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes to the atmosphere, forcing us to rethink the ecology and environmental dynamics of this powerful greenhouse gas. Different autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, Cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae and even macrophytes) produce CH<sub>4 </sub>in oxic environments. Known processes include activity of nitrogenases, demethylation of methylphosphonates, methylamines or DMSP, while cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton produce CH<sub>4 </sub>in oxic waters during photosynthesis - often in combination with stresses via the presence of reactive oxygen species. Yet unknown or recently published processes including purely chemical reactions likely contribute as well. It was suggested that these processes can account for most of the CH<sub>4 </sub>flux in the oceans and in freshwaters, e.g. reaching up to 85% in stratified, temperate lakes. In addition, CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in oxygen saturated surface waters may have also been underestimated. As both processes are influenced by temperature, light, nutrient availability and aquatic food web dynamics, climate change has the potential to alter CH<sub>4 </sub>formation and consumption in oxic water layers, with profound consequences for atmospheric CH<sub>4 </sub>flux and climate feedback.

However, trait-based ecology, a common approach in terrestrial ecology that is rarely used in marine ecosystems, could provide a simple and rapid approach for estimating herbivory on tropical reefs. We tested this hypothesis on five fringing reefs on Moorea, French Polynesia. We estimated relative herbivory with a bioassay and measured seven algal traits related to herbivory (volume, height, wet and dry weight, percent calcification, tensile strength, and toughness) of the calcifying macroalgae, Halimeda opuntia. Herbivory differed significantly among sites (ANOVA p &lt;0.0001), with an ~ 8-fold difference between the lowest and highest pressures. Algal traits varied concomitantly; algae from high herbivory sites were larger, allocated more mass to structure, and were more functionally diverse (PERMANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001) than low herbivory sites. A field experiment manipulating herbivory (none, ambient, simulated) showed algae subject to simulated and ambient herbivory occupied similar trait space, confirming that herbivory caused algal trait differences. Results show the power of trait-based ecology for estimating herbivory on macroalgal-dominated coral reefs, providing an important tool for the study and management of coral reef ecosystems.",0,,6/8/23 8:30,6/8/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,
4612,SS001P ASLO Multicultural Program Student Symposium,Jordan,Miles,milesjordan238@gmail.com,Long term press changes in Antarctic phytoplankton biomass and krill abundance for the rapidly changing West Antarctic Peninsula,"Over the last two decades, climate change has significantly affected glaciers, sea ice, and ice sheets along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), resulting in the accelerated retreat and melting of these habitats. This has led to a change in the trophic levels in the food webs. Shifts in phytoplankton biomass and the phytoplankton community composition have been observed on the continental shelf. This is significant as phytoplankton are the base of the food web and are predicted to impact Antarctic krill communities. Long-term press change (global warming), which is changing the sea ice, is hypothesized to affect the phytoplankton biomass composition. This, in turn, will affect the krill abundance and the trophic levels of food webs in the West Antarctic peninsula. The goal of this research is to study these processes. Using data collected over the past decade from the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER). I will combine the biological and chemical phytoplankton data into a time series. This will allow me to assess the high-ice years of the producers and determine if the changing ice conditions are mirrored in the phytoplankton and zooplankton data. &nbsp;",0,155,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Advances in trait-based ecology (TBE), however, provide a novel approach to address this important question. Here, we employ TBE to test how algal diversity impacts ecosystem function, specifically algal productivity, a timely question as algae are displacing corals on reefs globally. Using five macroalgal species with diverse functional traits we created six experimental treatments—five monospecific and one including all five species, each with 8 replicates. We quantified 12 traits related to productivity or productivity trade-offs (seven direct, five ratios) over a period of 14 days, measuring productivity as change in biomass. Trait data ordination plots revealed that each species occupied unique and relatively small areas of trait space grown in monoculture compared to when part of a diverse community. Moreover, five of 12 traits (volume, surface area, wet and dry weight, and toughness) increased linearly related to productivity, with more diverse communities being more productive than monocultures. Combined, results show that increased biodiversity increases an ecosystem function—productivity—and highlights the power of TBE for exploring basic ecological questions in coral reef ecosystems, providing insights into algal community dynamics that could help shape coral reef conservation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;",1,,6/8/23 8:30,6/8/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,

As part of the Palmer Antarctica Long-Term Ecological Research program, we examined long-term (1993 to the present) and spatial trends in fecal pellet carbon production by zooplankton along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. While large, solitary (asexual stage) salps produced fecal pellets with the highest individual carbon content, adult Antarctic krill (<em>Euphausia superba)</em>, due to their higher abundance, contributed the most to fecal pellet production (FPP) at the community level.&nbsp;<em>E. superba</em>&nbsp;FPP follows a 5-year cyclic pattern in peak FPP which is tied to their abundance and life cycle. Salp FPP peaks occur in years of massive salp blooms, which do not occur in the same years as krill FPP peaks. Due to their habitat preferences, adult&nbsp;<em>E. superba</em>dominated FPP in the coastal and far south subregions of the WAP, while salps (aggregate, sexual stage) dominated the south and slope subregions. FPP in krill and salps is thus a function of animal size, abundance, and environmental conditions. Long-term, or interannual, alteration in ecosystem structure from one dominated by krill to one by salps could directly affect export of fecal pellet carbon.&nbsp;",2,,6/8/23 8:30,6/8/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,
4618,SS001A ASLO Multicultural Program Student Symposium,Hawkins,Pa-Shun,pashunhawkins@gmail.com,"Linking Biomass of Herbivorous Fishes to Varying Levels of Herbivory Pressure in Moorea, French Polynesia","Coral reefs are critical ecosystems that promote high levels of biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services. However, the biodiversity and the ecosystem services they deliver are under threat because of anthropogenic stressors. As a result, coral cover is vastly diminishing, and coral reefs are globally undergoing phase shifts. Phase shifts refer to the transition of coral-dominated reefs into algal-dominated reefs. This study was conducted in Moorea, French Polynesia because Moorea’s coral reefs are enduring an algal-dominated shift. The transition of coral-dominated reefs into an algal-dominated system has been linked to the overharvesting of herbivorous fishes. Herbivorous fishes are responsible for consuming algae in coral reefs before algae outcompete corals for space. Although herbivorous fishes have the same role of maintaining algal growth, they also have species-specific differences. Some of these differences are in behaviors, feeding preferences, impacts on the benthic community, and biomass. These differences can alter how much a fish consumes algae. In this study, we focused on biomass. Biomass accounts for the caloric intake and energy requirements of a fish. &nbsp;In the past, researchers used abundance to quantify the amount of algal consumption occurring at a particular site. However, this study's objective was to determine if the biomass of herbivorous fishes was a better indicator of algal consumption than abundance. To address our objective, we determined how the abundance and biomass of herbivorous fishes explain the variation in algal consumption. The total amount of algal consumption at each study site was assessed using bioassays. We also performed fish surveys to determine the abundance of fish across sites. Later, abundance data was transformed into biomass data using a length-weight relation via FishBase. We find that the biomass of herbivorous fishes marginally outperformed the abundance of herbivorous fishes in explaining algal consumption and that fewer larger grazers may be more effective in limiting the algal abundance of herbivorous fishes. This study provides insight into the influential role of grazers in the transition of coral reefs from coral to algal-dominated systems. Addressing how herbivorous fishes influence algal abundance will assist in management aimed at avoiding and limiting phase shifts of coral reefs.",3,,6/8/23 8:30,6/8/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,

A strong negative correlation between total macroalgal cover and sea ice concentration was documented. However, the remote sensing-derived sea ice concentrations used in this analysis are at a larger spatial scale (25 kilometers on a side) compared to the size of the sampling sites (about 100 meters across). To investigate differences in measured sea ice concentrations across these two spatial scales, moderate spatial resolution Landsat satellite imagers (30-meter pixel resolutions) were used to determine how representative the large footprint sea ice concentrations were of that occurring at the smaller sampling sites. An algorithm based on a Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) approach classified the Landsat images as either sea ice, clouds, or ocean within 100, 300, and 3000 meter buffers around the site. In general, the larger footprint sensors indicated lower sea ice concentrations than the Landsat observations; the differences observed were consistent regardless of buffer size around each site. This indicates that while the sites had higher sea ice concentrations than retrieved for the larger pixels, the higher concentrations were consistent at spatial scales from 100s to 1000s of meters. Wind and current exposure were ruled out as a major cause for the scatter in the observed correlation between sea ice concentrations and macroalgae coverage.",1,144,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Larvae of many benthic invertebrates metamorphose in response to ecological parameters such as habitat and adult chemical cues. We utilized field-caught larvae to test whether an adult crab's conspecific cues influenced the megalopa stage's duration and triggered settlement and subsequent metamorphosis. The three species of fiddler crabs had varying responses to the adult chemical cues and demonstrated their respective selectivities for choosing a settlement site. U.pugilator molted in all conditions regardless of salinity or adult exudate. U. pugnax molted the most in their conspecific water treatment, yet molted more often in 20ppt than 10 ppt. U. minax was the most selective and hardly molted at all, indicating other chemical stimuli may be necessary for stimulating and accelerating their molting and settlement site selection.",2,140,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,
4623,SS001P ASLO Multicultural Program Student Symposium,Cho,Anika,ascho1@crimson.ua.edu,Bubbles And Burrows: Characterizing the Fracture Behavior of Marine Sediments Via Bubble Injection,"Cohesive marine sediments are elastic materials through which worms extend burrows and bubbles form&nbsp;by fracture. Burrowing behavior is dependent on the stiffness and fracture toughness (K1C) of muds. However, data for these properties are extremely limited, especially on small scales relevant to burrowers. In this study, a custom apparatus was&nbsp;built to measure the fracture toughness of cohesive sediments using a bubble injection method. The system induces fracture in sediment samples by incrementally injecting air through a needle and monitoring the rising air pressure until it drops, indicating bubble formation. Fracture toughness is then calculated from the critical pressure at which fracture occurred. It was hypothesized that this method would better characterize fracture behavior in the context of burrowing than previous, non-hydraulic methods because it employs fluid pressure, which is also generated by the bioirrigation activities of worms. Upon comparison with a non-hydraulic corkscrew probe method, bubble injection produced measurements that compared well to previous data and were more consistent with depth than those acquired with the corkscrew probe, which appears to overestimate fracture toughness at depth. These results suggest that hydraulic pressure may be an important aspect of burrowing mechanics that has been previously overlooked.",3,146,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Historically, the Hampton River once hosted large, productive Eastern oyster (<em>Crassostrea virginica</em>) reefs and the city of Hampton possessed the largest shelling operation in the world. Today, the Hampton River is a heavily urbanized and impacted estuary; although some reefs remain, they are highly degraded. Considering the great economic, ecological, and socio-cultural importance of oyster reefs, the effects of urbanization are worth considering.

Nonetheless, many details remain unknown regarding the transfer of the seawater Ce anomaly to the solid phase and its diagenetic stability, as well as the exact mechanism of oxidation, making correct interpretation of the proxy a matter of ongoing debate. Although negative Ce anomalies are generally taken to indicate the presence of free oxygen, various pathways affect this relationship including catalytic oxidation on the surface of Mn oxides and Ce complexation with strong organic ligands. We have investigated the effect of a model organic ligand, the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB), through a combination of potentiometric titrations and spectrophotometry. Others have shown that DFOB promotes the oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) inside the complex, whereupon its binding is strengthened by many orders of magnitude, previously preventing an accurate titrimetric measurement of the Ce(III)–DFOB stability constants. We determined the ability of various reductants, including hydroxylamine and L-ascorbic acid, to impede or reverse the reaction, which appears to depend on the presence of free oxygen. Our acquired insights into the oxidation mechanism represent a critical first step toward a more comprehensive kinetic model. Given the ubiquitous presence and variety of organic molecules in the marine environment, even a qualitative interpretation of the Ce paleoredox proxy is an intricate problem that should be approached with proper caution.",5,174,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The largest glacial floods emanate from ice-dammed lakes on the margins of destabilizing ice sheets. No megafloods have been documented since the early Holocene, but at the end of the last ice age, numerous megafloods produced peak discharge rates &gt;1,000,000 cubic m/sec. Among the largest of these were outbursts of Glacial Lake Missoula, as the southern ice margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet receded after the Last Glacial Maximum ~20,000 years ago. Freshwater and sediment discharged by the Missoula megafloods reached the Pacific via the Columbia River. Here we characterize megaflood deposits recorded in core OC2006A-10JC offshore the Columbia River (46° 16.723’N, 124° 52.310’W, 839 m water depth). We measured physical properties including density and magnetic susceptibility, analyzed bulk elemental geochemistry by XRF, and imaged depositional structures by CT scans. Diatom species assemblages were analyzed in layers deposited during and after the floods. Planktic and benthic foraminifera as well as terrestrial macrofossils were radiocarbon dated to quantify changes in marine 14C reservoir ages, and to define the timing of lithostratigraphic boundaries. The chronology also constrains the duration of system recovery after flood events. Modern warming is now causing ice-dammed lakes to proliferate in Greenland and along other ice margins. Our results on past megafloods can shed light on the potential marine impacts of future glacial lake outbursts.&nbsp;",4,,6/8/23 8:30,6/8/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,

Mutualisms, such as positive interactions, &nbsp;have been shown to increase the stress tolerance of a variety of species including corals. Studies have shown that in tropical corals, mutualisms with symbiotic zooxanthellae, increaeses coral tolerance to stress. However, less is known about its impact on temperate corals. Here we investigate how facultative mutualisms between the temperate coral <em>Astrangia poculata</em>, and it’s symbiotic zooxanthellae, impact their resilience to sediment stress. <em>A.poculata </em>is a unique coral because it exists naturally with and without these symbionts. Sedimentation is a growing threat to corals due to processes such as bottom trawling and shoreline development. This results in highly turbid marine waters with reduced light penetration.&nbsp;In this study we investigate how&nbsp; sediment inundation affect corals both with and without symbiotic zooxanthellae, and how their stress responses vary with time. The results have shown that corals with symbiotic zooxanthellae, have minimal energetic advantages relative to their counterparts without zooxanthellae, which was counterintuitive.

Managing these stressors requires quantification of magnitude and effect, which can be time consuming and costly. Trait-based ecology approaches in terrestrial systems have demonstrated how environmental conditions can shape plant community traits; we posit community traits can be leveraged as indicators of anthropogenic stressors in coral reef systems. To test this, we compared algal community traits across sites with varying nutrient, sediment, and overfishing stress on five fringing reefs on Moorea, French Polynesia. We quantified the relative strength of these stressors with bioassays, showed significant differences among sites, and identified stressor ‘hot spots’. We randomly collected 20-25 algae from each site, measured seven functional traits, and used an ordination approach to delineate trait space, quantify occupancy across sites, and link both occupancy and trait values to environmental drivers. We found sites varied significantly in their occupancy of trait space, and loading plots indicated trait values shifted in response to environmental stressors. For example, algae responded to sediments by maximizing surface area relative to dry weight or height relative to dry weight, both traits likely aiding in acquisition of light. These results demonstrate algal community traits provide insights into the intensity of anthropogenic stressors, providing crucial information to guide local monitoring plans.",0,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza B,

The settlement of planktonic coral larvae plays an essential role in the growth and longevity of coral reefs. Settlement occurs when coral larvae attach to a substrate and metamorphize into a juvenile coral, adding to an existing reef or beginning a new coral reef. It is known that coral larvae tend to settle and metamorphize on crustose coralline algae which produces beneficial chemical cues that promote settlement. &lt;em&gt;<em>Ramicrusta textilis</em>&lt;/em&gt; is an encrusting alga that is highly invasive in the Caribbean. In addition to its rapid spread, there is no record of juvenile coral recruitment on &lt;em&gt;<em>R. textilis</em>&lt;/em&gt; which has raised concerns about its suitability as a substrate for settlement.

Knowing how anthropogenic and environmental stressors affect the immune function and the viability of belugas can reveal more about ecosystem health. Monitoring the health of wild beluga populations will also help inform conservation management decisions, especially towards critically endangered stocks such as Cook Inlet Belugas in Alaska. Research with trained whales aims to validate non-invasive techniques of assessing health that will be applied to wild whales. One potential health-monitoring method is examining expression for immune system genes in blow (respiratory exhale). This project aims to investigate diurnal rhythms of immune system gene expression in beluga blow and examine the correlations between changes in blow and blood. This study asked (1) if immune system gene expression in belugas varies at certain times of the day? and (2) if there is a difference between immune system gene expression in beluga blow vs. blood? Paired blood and blow samples were collected monthly and hourly from three trained whales (two adult females and one adult male) at Mystic Aquarium during winter and spring in 2020 and 2022. RNA was extracted and quantified from the samples, then reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA. Two selected genes, IL8 (target inflammatory gene) and GAPDH (reference gene), were amplified and measured through qPCR. The results show that overall IL8 expression in the blood (t-test) and blow (ANOVA) for all whales did not significantly change during the day and that the whales showed individual variation. There was also no significant correlation between blood and blow (Pearson’s <em>r</em> = -0.5512, p = 0.0789). Blow and blood were significantly different (p&lt;0.05). Given the small size, though, this should be evaluated further. Future research will continue collecting seasonal paired samples and expand the number of trained individuals included in the study.

Little is known about the ecological role of transparency in benthic fauna. One hypothesis is that transparency is a form of camouflage that involves the entire organism and may be a mechanism to avoid predation. The level of organismal transparency is highly influenced by the number of pigment cells, i.e. melanocytes and xanthophores, and it is currently unclear if environmental factors can influence the number and color of pigment cells. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine if the grass shrimp found in the Chesapeake Bay undergo changes in pigmentation when exposed to different optical surroundings. To study this phenomenon, we held grass shrimp in small tanks wrapped in colored material to simulate brown, green, or orange backgrounds that may correspond to different viable habitats occupied by the grass shrimp. Shrimp collected from the James River, VA, were exposed to a color background treatment for two weeks in two separate trials. Shrimp were then photographed over blue construction at 1X resolution using a Teclast microscope camera. The level of translucency was measured by assessing the level of blue background pigment showing through the grass shrimp. From captured images, melanocytes and xanthophores from each individual shrimp sample in each treatment were randomly quantified with a grid overlay using ImageJ software. Our preliminary results show there was a significant difference between backgrounds in melanocyte and xanthophore numbers, with shrimp in the brown tank exhibiting a significantly lower number of pigment cells. This may lead to a difference in shrimp transparency levels in shrimp exposed to different backgrounds.

We observed a wide range of future distribution patterns among study species including movement north, movement offshore, an overall decline in CPUE, an overall increase in CPUE, movement deeper in the water column, movement shallower in the water column, a combination of various outcomes, and minimal change in CPUE. Overall, there are many potential consequences of distribution changes for groundfishes along the west coast in response to climate change.

In 2005, over 250 thousand hectares in Florida were treated with more than 500,000 kg of Cu. In 2007, the US EPA ranked Cu contamination as one of the top-heavy metals accountable for the decrease in water quality in US water bodies. Due to the extensive use of Cu in Florida and its inability to degrade, Cu has accumulated and remains persistent in Florida’s aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to Cu has been found to impair neurotransmitter and chemosensory functions in fish. An excellent method to study Cu sub-lethal effects is fish swimming performance. This study aimed to determine the effects of Cu on predator-prey interactions between largemouth bass and Sailfin mollies in freshwater (FW). Fish (n=11) were acclimated to FW and exposed to 7.20 – 8.20 ug/L Cu for 96 h. At the end of the exposure, predator-prey interactions were assessed. Sailfin mollies were presented to visual cues, chemical cues and a combination of visual, chemical and physical cues and tested on changes in behavior that may affect their predator avoidance techniques. In Phase 2, predator-prey interactions were studied by introducing a live predator to determine the prey mortality rate. Our results showed that Cu had an effect on visual cues on prey in both Phases 1 and 2. Adverse effects of Cu on fish swimming performance and predator-prey interactions can result in a decline in population survival.",6,171,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,
4714,SS001P ASLO Multicultural Program Student Symposium,Layeni,Amira,amira.layeni@my.hamptonu.edu,"Microplastic deposition in urbanized, temperate oyster reefs","Plastic pollution is a growing environmental concern due to the recalcitrant nature of plastics, making them valuable in many consumer products. As plastics deteriorate and fragment, they become microplastics (&lt;5mm) and are deposited in vast quantities in the soil, air, and water. While biochemically inert, many microplastics infiltrate food webs and become bioavailable. The many sizes, shapes, and polymer compositions allow microplastics to be available to nearly every primary consumer. In estuarine and coastal regions, critical areas in which the majority of seafood is dependent, microplastic deposition tends to be high due to local, riverine, and oceanic plastic subsidies. Here, we describe the pervasiveness of microplastics discovered in different components of oyster reef habitat across urbanized Southeastern Chesapeake Bay tributaries: the Hampton and Lynnhaven Rivers. We quantified the abundance and polymer types of microplastics from the reef-water interface, oyster reef sediments, and Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) tissue. Sediments serve as a legacy indicator of microplastic deposition and water samples provide a discrete sample of microplastic availability at the time of sampling; however, microplastics within oyster tissues represent a clear pathway for microplastic resuspension within food webs. Our results demonstrate clear linkages between microplastic deposition and uptake into marine food webs. Given the volume of plastic waste generated, microplastics will continue to flood ecosystems without substantial regulatory and behavioral changes.&nbsp;",9,156,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Freshwater flow into Padilla Bay, WA (USA) is regulated by tide gates on sloughs that drain agricultural land, including the Joe Leary slough. This study investigated: (a) changes in water quality on both sides of the Joe Leary tide gate, (b) if freshwater from the slough was detectable in the bay, and (c) if variation in eelgrass condition was evident alongside the presence of freshwater from the slough. To characterize variation in water quality, we collected hourly water samples and deployed in situ monitoring instruments logging standard water quality metrics. To measure variation in eelgrass metrics, we adapted established protocols to assess reproductive effort, epiphyte biomass, and wasting disease at two estuarine monitoring sites downstream of the mouth of the slough in the bay. We found that immediately near the tide gate, depth, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature exhibited pulsing patterns that may be related to the opening and closing of the gate, which was also correlated with the diurnal cycle during the sampling period. Phosphate and ammonium concentrations were linked to salinity near the tide gate. Interestingly, the freshwater pulsing signal was not detected at the eelgrass monitoring sites. Wasting disease was low at both eelgrass sites; however, we found more flowering shoots and greater epiphyte biomass at the site closest to the mouth of the slough.",11,154,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

They are a vulnerable component of the cryosphere, losing mass through calving events and melting (either at the surface or at the glacial bed). Glacial melting comprised of 21% of sea level rise over the last two decades. Large-scale calving events are well-documented and a focus of glaciological research. On the contrary, a relatively small amount is known about processes by which ice melts, is stored, and changes on the surfaces of glaciers. This study aims to categorize the different melt features, such as crevasses, ponds, streams, and blue ice, for Greenland and Antarctic glaciers, and determine their size and abundance. QGIS, an open-source geographic information system application, was used to map and measure the area and length of these features on Helheim Glacier on Greenland and Beardmore, Marsh/Nimrod, and Lennox King Glaciers on Antarctica. The results of this study showed that water-filled crevasses were the largest melt features present on all glaciers, averaging a size of 39.24 km<sup>2</sup>. Most of the other meltwater features were located within or near crevasse fields. The most abundant meltwater features overall were ponds with a total of 75 identified across all 4 glaciers, Marsh/Nimrod Glacier contributing 61 of those ponds. The least abundant as well as the smallest melt features were streams, with an average length of 28.49 km. On Helheim Glacier specifically, blue ice was the most abundant melt feature. This is important to our overall understanding of glacier mass loss and hydrology because it shows that the surfaces of glaciers are dynamic and store meltwater in a variety of features. These features need to be monitored and measured annually to understand their temporal variability and how/if surface meltwater contributes to sea level rise.",5,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza B,

Here we provide an analysis of marine sediment core samples as a means to observe how the Benguela Upwelling System was impacted by climatic changes across the Plio-Pleistocene transition. The Pliocene is an epoch 5.3 to 2.6 mya whose climate conditions serve as an analog for Earth’s climate in the near future. Using data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1085, benthic δ<sup>18</sup>O, sea surface temperature, alkenone abundance, and color reflectance were compared over 1,600 ka extending across the Plio-Pleistocene transition. Our results demonstrate that reflectivity mirrors benthic δ<sup>18</sup>O measured at Site 1085, and upwelling conditions consistently decrease during interglacial periods. Our findings provide insight into how the productivity of coastal upwelling regions may change in response to a changing climate, which has the potential to impact local biodiversity and coastal economies.

Through processes such as photo-oxidation and physical abrasion, larger macroplastics can degrade in the natural environment into MPs, which are transported by wind currents and become concentrated in the air we breathe. This study aimed to analyze atmospheric MPs, particularly the variation of MP concentration, size, color, and composition between urban and rural areas. We set stainless steel buckets to collect atmospheric deposition of MPs in three sites in Massachusetts, USA varying in population size: Boston, Franklin, and Nantucket Island. After a two-week collection period, the samples were filtered, treated with concentrated hydrogen peroxide, and heated to digest any organic material present in the sample. These digested samples were density-separated before being examined under a microscope to count each individual MP. A subsample of MPs was then measured using Image Analysis and analyzed using FTIR to identify their chemical composition. In contrast to our predictions, results suggested the Franklin site had the largest concentration of MPs with an average of 52.6 MPs per square meter per day, while Nantucket Island and Boston followed in sequential order averaging 23.3 and 15.2 MPs per square meter per day respectively. The more rural areas, Franklin and Nantucket, also had a greater variation of colors, a wider range in MP size, and a larger proportion of petroleum-based plastics than the Boston site.",20,147,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Like other marine species, the eastern oyster hosts a complex microbiome, including beneficial bacteria, opportunistic commensals, such as Aeromonas media, and potentially lethal pathogens such as Roseovarius crassostreae, Haplosporidium costale, and Vibrio splendidus. Detecting bacterial oyster pathogens is a challenge because of their broad diversity and because pathogens are often closely related to nonpathogenic strains. In this project, we developed a detection method using portable third generation sequencers that can capture, with high-resolution, the genetic diversity of members of the wild oyster microbiome, including potential pathogens. Oysters were collected from various restored reefs in the Hudson River Estuary system, preserved, and genomic DNA extraction was optimized for efficiency and for preservation of long strands. Full-length rRNA genes (4,200 bp) were amplified and sequenced on a Nanopore MinION system, giving high-resolution taxonomic coverage that allowed for the identification of several pathogens from these microbiomes and identification of infected individual oysters. As the project expands, we will apply this method to determine how environmental factors such as warming can impact the proliferation of pathogens at restored reefs, and try to determine thresholds for the onset of bacterial infections.",4,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza B,

Likely to be deposit feeders, mud shrimp feed on their burrow lining, thus, the relationship between burrow surface area and shrimp biomass could reveal the trophic and broader ecological significance of burrows. The invasive isopod parasite <em>Orthione griffenis</em> is driving <em>Upogebia&nbsp;</em>to extinction across its range, and may search for productive burrows to detect suitable hosts; thus, the burrow surface area to biomass ratio may be important for parasite settlement as well. Methods of measuring burrow surface area and volume such as resin casting are expensive and highly destructive to the mudflat. Instead, we estimated burrow surface area using a deep sediment core in Yaquina Bay, Oregon, and compared these estimates to existing resin cast data for shrimp species worldwide. Our estimation method yielded a close surface area to biomass ratio that appears to be either location- or substrate-specific, but is not clearly species-specific. This calls into question previous claims about species-specificity of burrow dimensions and feeding styles, provides evidence that parasites may indirectly target burrows, and suggests that sediment cores produce cheaper and less destructive burrow samples that may be more accurate.",21,143,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The impact of this decline on their ecological relationship with Arctic grayling (<em>Thymallus arcticus</em>), however, is not well understood. We are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to assess spatiotemporal variation in Arctic grayling abundances at seven locations located above, within, and below Chinook salmon spawning grounds on the Chena River throughout the period of adult salmon migration. This project leverages Chinook salmon count data produced during a Yukon River Basin salmon eDNA study collected in partnership with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG). At the University of Alaska’s (UA) Museum of the North, we are developing and implementing eDNA studies relying on species-specific qPCR assays. We filtered eDNA samples from seven sites in the Chena River during three sampling events in the summer of 2022 that coincided with periods of time before, during, and after the Chinook salmon run, respectively. We anticipate finding an abundance of Arctic grayling during the Chinook salmon spawning area of the Chena River. With these findings, we would have a better understanding of how to utilize eDNA sampling as a lower-cost, less-intensive approach to salmon monitoring. This tool has the ability to develop and fine-tune river-specific training and sampling protocols that state, federal, and tribal entities can sustainably employ as part of their long-term salmon monitoring projects.",18,167,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Currently there are over 30 known ARs off California but no formal monitoring program exists to study the biological communities they support (Hunter, 2020). The Palos Verdes Shelf contains a rocky reef ecosystem which has been impacted by DDT and PCB contamination from the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant’s Whites Point Outfall and historic landslides which continue to heavily impact many of the area’s low-lying reefs with chronic sedimentation and burial (Pondella et al 2013). Artificial reefs were constructed in this area in 2020 as a part of NOAA Montrose Settlements Restoration Program to restore fish habitats. Informal visual surveys are conducted at this site by the Vantuna Research group to determine its success but only once a year. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a method that could be applied for more detailed biomonitoring of this type of restoration. eDNA is an innovative method of monitoring biodiversity based on the genetic material organisms leave behind in the environment but lacks the established methods for its application in different conservation situations. This project aims to compare eDNA signals from a recently completed AR to nearby natural reefs as well as to traditional SCUBA surveys. Samples have been taken seasonally since before the construction of the reef in 2020 to probe for fish diversity. I am also collaborating with peers to conduct concurrent kelp canopy drone-mapping, and biogeochemical sampling to compare habitat types, local ocean chemistry, seasonal dynamics, and the composition of biodiversity which we aim to uncover using eDNA.

A proposed environmentally friendly approach to controlling harmful blooms has centered around <em>Shewanella </em>sp.

DinoSHIELD technology was designed to control dinoflagellate growth through the immobilization of <em>Shewanella </em>sp. IRI-160 in alginate hydrogel beads. Little research has been conducted to test the efficacy of DinoSHIELDs on dinoflagellates outside of the laboratory. This study evaluated strategies for the deployment of DinoSHIELDs in the environment at different water flow condition sites. Two trials were conducted, one with a 24-hour deployment period and one with a seven-day deployment period. Results indicated that the deployment of DinoSHIELDs was effective in decreasing the dinoflagellate growth for trial two, though not for trial one.

Aquaculture accounted for more than half of the world’s seafood supply between 1997-2017, with mollusk mariculture contributing to about a quarter of that rise. Georgia was once a leading producer in the nation’s oyster fishery, but its harvest is now the smallest in the Southeast. Oyster aquaculture, supported by a thriving hatchery program, could contribute to the revival of the shellfish industry in Georgia and the regeneration of vital oyster habitats. Most hatcheries depend on intake water from local estuaries, which is subject to coastal acidification. Growers often amend low pH intake with bicarbonate, but the optimum range or upper limit has not been established. To help guide growers, we evaluated the larvae of Georgia’s cultivated variety of Crassostrea virginica and their ability to tolerate high pH conditions. A series of incubation experiments were conducted to measure the growth, survival, and mortality of C. virginica larvae at the University of Georgia, Shellfish Research Lab in Savannah, Georgia. pH levels were manipulated by adding sodium bicarbonate to seawater to identify the optimum pH range. Oyster larvae did not grow or survive at the expected rate based on their life cycle stages measure by sieve size, causing a decline in larval survival and indicating that life cycle day played a larger role in the growth and survival than the pH treatment. We also found mortality was not impacted by pH treatment or life cycle day. This study suggests that maternal lipids may play an important role in supporting C. virginica growth and survival prior to day nine of the life cycle.

This study aimed to (1) identify and quantify fouling communities and (2) determine the effects of biofouling control practices and stocking density on biofouling communities measured by assessing, (a) biofouling weight on oyster bags and (b) biofouling on mesh settlement plates attached on the outside and suspended within floating oyster bags subjected to the different treatment combinations. Colonizing organisms (tubeworm fouling and bryozoans) were the most prominent taxa found across most settlement mesh plates. Air drying frequently reduced biofouling, producing significantly lighter wet weights on mesh plates and grow-out bags than non-air-dried treatments (p &lt; 0.01).

We are studying the composition and the age of volcanic ash layers in core VM33-116 and the surrounding 18 volcanoes to determine which Holocene eruptions were large enough to be recorded in ice cores' sulfate records. We also want to learn if layers with higher magnetic susceptibility have more abundant volcanic glass and if volcanic eruptions increase the local submarine biological productivity. A Bartington magnetic susceptibility meter and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to measure magnetic susceptibility and changes in overall foraminiferal and volcanic glass compositions. PETDB database and GeoMap App were used to discern and compare possible volcano candidates’ chemical compositions and caldera width. Results show a magnetic susceptibility peak at 39-40 cm, and in the &gt;250u fraction: we found the most abundant volcanic glass in the layer at 38-39 cm. Additionally, a bright red C-rich grain with barite crystals was found in the 38-39 cm layer, and black foraminifera coated with Mn and Fe oxides were found at 40-41cm. More black foraminifera were found at 184-185cm, 204-205cm, and 214-215 cm within a single 35 cm thick ash layer. In the deeper layers (184-185 cm, 204-205 cm, 214-215 cm) in VM33-116, we found Mn, Fe, and Ni coatings on the internal surfaces of the black foraminifera.

We cultured E. hux (CCMP 374) in seawater f/2-Si media amended to produce three OAE conditions: A control treatment with no alkalinity modification, an unequilibrated group for which we increased media alkalinity(+500 &amp;micromol/kg) without equilibration with atmospheric carbon dioxide(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and an equilibrated group where alkalinity was increased(+500 &amp;micromol/kg), followed by bubbling to restore its pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to atmospheric values. To assess E. hux response we reviewed three main factors: growth rate, calcification rate, and photosynthetic health. Growth rates were determined with flow cytometry; calcification rates were determined using a novel &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-tracer technique; photosynthetic health was assessed by measuring Fv/Fm. Over four generations the growth rates of all three treatments were similar. Calcification rates, cellular calcite quotas, and Fv/Fm all showed no measurable response to OAE. These results imply that unequilibrated and air-equilibrated alkalinity enhancement may have little to no effect on E. hux growth and calcification rates under laboratory culture conditions. Future work should investigate if these results persist over longer time periods and more extreme alkalinity loadings. Natural open-ocean coccolithophore communities should also be investigated in situ.

Chapple [2] [1] American River College, [2] Costal Oregon Marine Experiment Station, Oregon State University &nbsp; Animals experience a wide range of stimuli that can affect their behavior and disrupt homeostasis. Following the introduction of a stressor, many animals respond with an increased level of activity (i.e., flight) that can be behaviorally or energetically costly. While this increase in activity can help reduce immediate predation risk, it can cause indirect decreases in foraging, maintenance, and eventually the ability to aggregate or reproduce. While there are many physiological responses to a stressor, a highly notable response is behavioral change. In nature, elasmobranchs face pursuit from predators, the risk of capture from fishing, and a myriad of possible events that can evoke a stress response and subsequent indirect consequences. Understanding stress response and return to baseline behavior can reveal the characteristics and duration that an animal is at an increased stressed state. We used&nbsp;<em>Myliobatis californica</em>as a model to study the response and recovery of elasmobranchs to acute stress events. We induced a stress response in study animals by handling them for a brief period and filmed pre/post-handling. The footage was analyzed for changes in behavioral state, velocity, bearing, and distance moved. In comparison to their behavioral baseline, animals exhibited an increase in both movement and speed before returning to typical behavior indicative of an acute stress response. Understanding changes in behavior can indicate how long their behavioral stress response last and forms a foundation for interpreting behavioral research on elasmobranchs. These findings can have impacts on the current understanding of elasmobranch post-release mortality, the post-release data collected in elasmobranch research, and the creation of elasmobranch policies such as bycatch limits or fishing regulations. &nbsp; &nbsp;",14,151,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Organic carbon decomposition is slow in peatland ecosystems and allows them to become stable carbon reservoirs over millennia. However, the carbon preservation mechanisms within peatlands are poorly understood. This project aims to develop a deeper understanding of how peat stores carbon for long timescales by studying its molecular-level chemical composition. Samples from multiple peat cores were collected in southern Patagonia and probed for bromine speciation and concentration using X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The XANES data show that organobromine becomes progressively enriched downcore in a coastal peat core, suggesting organobromine may be biogeochemically stable in this location.&nbsp; To shed light on the chemical characterization of these samples, we also analyzed a subset of the peat samples using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The peat samples were freeze-dried, homogenized, and extracted with 1:1 v:v methanol:dichloromethane through sonication. A Bray-Curtis dissimilarity test was performed for all chemical features, revealing that the chemodiversity of these samples is driven by age. Specifically, surface (younger) samples show higher variability in chemical composition, while deeper (older) samples showed lower variability. These findings suggest that organic carbon biogeochemical processes may play a role in the convergence of chemical similarity in older samples. Two organohalides were also putatively annotated.",23,164,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The main goal of this study&nbsp;is to assess the effectiveness of DMTA as a tool to interpret diets of the common bottlenose&nbsp;dolphin, orca, beluga whale, walrus,&nbsp;sea otter, and sperm whale. Our preliminary results indicate that&nbsp;marine mammals such as sea otters, beluga whales, walruses and sperm whales eat significantly&nbsp;harder foods (with higher complexity, Asfc values) than the primarily fish consuming common&nbsp;bottlenose dolphin and orca. Additionally, there is little to no evidence that orcas, with the lowest&nbsp;Asfc values, are durophagous (i.e., eating hard foods). There is clear evidence that dolphins and orcas are consuming softer foods than the remaining taxa– which are known to eat invertebrates&nbsp;such as crustaceans and mollusks. Consequently, we found that dental microwear may be an&nbsp;effective tool to analyze the diets of extant and potentially extinct marine mammals, as the&nbsp;surface textures on their teeth correspond with observed diets. Dental microwear texture analysis&nbsp;may allow us to better understand the effects of climate change on marine mammal diets and may be used to track dietary changes from marine mammals in the historical past. It may also be&nbsp;used to potentially aid in developing conservation and management strategies.",2,,6/8/23 15:00,6/8/23 16:30,Sala Ibiza B,

This diel cycling of metabolism affects the presence of intra and extracellular metabolites in seawater, yet few in situ studies have assessed these overall changes. Through a week-long diel experiment conducted on the Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier, the change in presence and relative abundance of marine metabolites was observed in parallel with biogeochemical parameters (e.g., nutrients, dissolved organic carbon concentrations, etc.) and tidal and wave patterns. Dissolved metabolites were collected using solid phase extraction and analyzed by electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, alongside particulate metabolites collected on Teflon filters. Diel fluctuations of unknown metabolites were further annotated using<em> </em>in-silico tools to obtain their stoichiometric and molecular class identifications. A dinoflagellate bloom progressed throughout the week of the study which greatly impacted the metabolites observed. Recycled nitrogen concentrations and anthropogenic activity correlated strongly to variation within the metabolite community. These molecules were explored to provide insight into the potential cycling of organic nitrogen compounds involved in inorganic nutrient variability.

The physical impact of corals ingesting microplastics has been well studied, but the chemical threat that microplastics may pose to these organisms has been understudied. The effect that microplastic-associated chemicals may have on coral reef health and reproduction has been unexplored. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if a difference exists between the effects of microplastics themselves and their associated chemicals on <em>Montipora capitata</em> fertilization rates. For this, gametes were exposed to either 4 types of 5 mm microplastic spheres (nylon, polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, or low-density polyethylene) at one of three concentrations (50, 100 or 200 particles per/L) or leachates from these same microplastics. The results showed that gamete fertilization was not impacted by plastic particles themselves, but leachates from these plastic particles heavily reduced fertilization rates for <em>Montipora capitata</em>. These findings are the first to show that microplastic-associated chemicals are an important stressor affecting coral reproduction. Thus, microplastic pollution might pose a threat to coral replenishment and persistence on coral reef ecosystems.",3,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza B,

Rotifer taxonomy is challenging, incomplete, and morphological and molecular evolution are often incongruous. Many rotifers display cryptic speciation in which a single species may represent a complex of morphologically indistinct species. Analyzing cryptic species diversity of rotifers can help elucidate patterns of biogeography and evolutionary relationships. <em>Lecane bulla</em> is a cosmopolitan monogonont found in a variety of water bodies that are heterogeneous and geographically separated, and they have high levels of morphological variation. Previous regional studies have demonstrated that <em>Lecane bulla</em> species is a cryptic species complex. In this study we address: (1) Are there additional cryptic species within the <em>Lecane bulla</em> complex in populations throughout North America? (2) Are there environmental correlates within particular genetic lineages? Within this species, evolutionary units will be inferred from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region sequences. We will sequence 20 new isolates from across the U.S. and Mexico, and include sequences in GenBank to identify potential cryptic species. Species will be delimited using Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent models Poisson Tree Processes, and Phylogenetics and Phylogeographies.

The CCE is oceanographically complex, with northerly currents contributing waters from the North Pacific and Subarctic, an undercurrent carrying tropical waters north, and seasonal upwelling leading to a strong cross-shore gradient in productivity. Though zooplankton play important ecological roles, much of their diversity is understudied, and traditional taxonomic methods can require extensive resources and expertise. Here we used DNA metabarcoding of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and 18S rRNA on size separated plankton tissue samples, to investigate diversity patterns across a longitudinal gradient spanning a large range of abiotic factors from coastal upwelling to 800 km offshore. The two markers presented compositionally distinct, yet complementary, perspectives of total plankton diversity, thus demonstrating the value of using multiple primers for broader views of pelagic diversity. Results revealed a cross-shore shift in mesozooplankton community composition correlated with temperature, nutrient concentrations, and primarily characterized by differences in size. Larger key arthropods were most abundant in nearshore communities, with greater richness of small zooplankton further offshore. This study forms a unique size-structured baseline characterizing zooplankton communities across a large environmental gradient that will enhance our ability to detect ecosystem shifts in response to global climate change.",3,,6/8/23 15:00,6/8/23 16:30,Sala Ibiza B,

Evidence suggests that many species of rotifers, aquatic invertebrates, are composed of cryptic species. We examined populations from the genus &lt;em&gt;Hexarthra &lt;/em&gt; found in the Chihuahuan Desert, a unique eco-region where complexes of cryptic species of other rotifers have been described. We hypothesized that these populations contain complexes of cryptic species. &lt;em&gt;Hexarthra &lt;/em&gt; were collected from water sources (active or dry) that are spatially separated and hydrologically disconnected. Individuals from live samples were isolated as were those hatched from diapausing eggs from sediments to produce clonal lineages and maintained under laboratory conditions. DNA was extracted, amplified, and sequenced using the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) marker. Analyses conducted to delimit cryptic species included Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) method, Poisson Tree Processes (PTP) modeling, and K/θ. Conservatively, we found representatives of 4 described species and 3 putative new species. Of the 4, &lt;em&gt;H. mira &lt;/em&gt; contained 3 distinct lineages while &lt;em&gt;H. fennica &lt;/em&gt; had 3. Two of the putative species were rock pool specialists, comprising 4 lineages.

In Antarctic regions like the Ross Sea, climate models suggest that increases in temperature and wind will cause substantial changes in the timing, duration, and extent of sea-ice coverage. We investigated the importance and potential impact of ice presence on the foraging behavior of an upper trophic level predator, the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). Describing the foraging behavior of Adélie penguins in association with the presence of sea-ice could provide insight into the impact of this habitat feature on the foraging strategy of this species. Video loggers were deployed on Adélie penguins (n=51) from Cape Crozier, Antarctica during the breeding seasons of 2018/2019 and 2021/2022. The video footage was manually annotated to identify prey capture events and ice associated dives. We will assess the influence of sea-ice on behavioral patterns including the type of prey captured and average dive depth. We will also compare two years of video data to determine annual differences between sea-ice concentration and the frequency of ice-associated foraging dives. Preliminary results suggest that Adélie penguins are foraging at shallower depths than expected when there is sea-ice present. The results of this study will help to understand the role of sea-ice in the foraging ecology of breeding Adélie penguins and the potential role climate change may play if sea ice coverage changes as predicted.",28,150,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Interestingly, the taxonomic assignments of 3 MAGs belonged to a novel bacterial phylum as supported by both GTDB-tk and ribosomal protein based analyses. Differential coverage analysis of the recovered MAGs across CR datasets indicated that this novel phylum was the most abundant in the deepest parts of the cores at both Site U1378 and U1379, down to 92 meters below seafloor. The collective metabolic reconstruction of this novel phylum indicated the presence of hydrogenic capacities using diverse groups of FeFe, NiFe and NiFeSe hydrogenases. Detailed metabolic reconstruction of the MAGs indicated the presence of genes encoding for anaerobic processing of benthic gasses, in particular hydrogen, to create a proton motive force fueling their ATP synthase to yield energy as well as carbon-dioxide fixation pathways, especially the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. We hypothesize that this bacteria cross-feeds neighboring microbes due to the presence of a large number of secondary metabolites and co-factors biosynthetic genes, as well as macromolecule biosynthetic pathways, coupled with a large set of transporters and secretory proteins. This novel subsurface-specific phylum most likely plays a role in recycling hydrogen from both geologic or biologic sources and sharing metabolites with the neighboring microbes. &nbsp;",5,,6/8/23 15:00,6/8/23 16:30,Sala Ibiza B,

Tardigrades have conserved some ancient gut gene expressions. To conduct this experiment, I looked at three different conserved transcription factors that regulate gut formation. &lt;em&gt;HNF-4&lt;/em&gt; is expressed in the midgut and &lt;em&gt;forkhead&lt;/em&gt; is throughout the entire gut, but it is unknown if &lt;em&gt;goosecoid&lt;/em&gt; expression is also conserved. Based on distant relatives that conserve the same genes, I predict &lt;em&gt;goosecoid&lt;/em&gt; will be expressed within the tardigrade foregut. Tardigrades have miniaturized and lost their mid-trunk region during evolution. They have also lost all the genes that would have been expressed within the mid-trunk region they lost. I investigated whether or not &lt;em&gt;goosecoid&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;expression was conserved despite these tardigrade body plan alterations. I performed HCR in-situs and observed six different developmental stages. I investigated &lt;em&gt;goosecoid&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;HNF-4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;forkhead&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;HNF-4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;forkhead&lt;/em&gt; were utilized as visual gut markers since their expression patterns are known to us. As development progresses, the gene signals regionalize and take on their respective patterns. By the last observed stage, it can be concluded, with the help of the marker genes, that &lt;em&gt;goosecoid&lt;/em&gt; expression is within the foregut as initially predicted. As a result, &lt;em&gt;goosecoid&lt;/em&gt; most likely regulates tardigrade foregut development and is another ancient regulator of gut development.",31,161,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Due to their coupling with proteins, miRNAs are typically more resistant to degradation than mRNAs but their resilience has not been examined in wildlife samples collected under non-sterile conditions. Here, we assessed miRNA viability in marine mammal skin tissues during a time-series experiment with various preservatives. We removed approximately 10 cm2 of epidermis from the latero-dorsal posterior flank of an early-decomposition common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) stranded in Virginia Beach, VA. Sub-samples (30-50 mg) were kept in the following preservatives in triplicate: frozen (-80°C), RNALater (4°C), 95% ETOH (4°C), and NaCl-saturated DMSO (4°C). MiRNA extractions were conducted on fresh tissues (control) and subsequently at 45, 93 and 143 days. A two-way ANOVA (followed by a Tukey HSD test) revealed significant difference among treatments only when the control (fresh) treatment was included (F= 12.72; p &lt; 0.001). Once this treatment was removed, no difference across preservatives was observed. In addition, tissues in all treatments lost roughly a third of the their miRNA amount after 45 days, but the loss stabilized over time. Our results confirmed the remarkable resilience of miRNAs and suggest that they can be reliably recovered from archived samples preserved with various methods at 4°C, in addition to tissues ideally frozen at -80°C.",32,160,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Temperature stress results in a phenomenon called coral bleaching, which means that the corals lose their endosymbiotic algae, resulting in decreased health, growth, and reproduction. We took various measures of symbiont cell density counts, Pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) &nbsp;fluorometry, chlorophyll-a analysis, and color scoring to measure the health of the algal symbionts after they were exposed to the thermal stress experiment. We also evaluated the outplant survival based on site and genotype, as well as the interaction between the two factors. It was found that the corals exposed to water temperatures that mimicked those of global climate change were less healthy than those grown in ambient water temperatures, although there was a difference by the coral site. We also found that the majority of tested measures had a positive correlation. This study provided a better understanding of which measures tell us the most about the health of the corals under temperature stress, which will provide more informed choices on what specific factors to measure during future bleaching experiments. Discovering what sites and genotypes perform better under thermal stress can also help pick the healthiest corals for future restoration projects. &nbsp;",33,163,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Ecohydraulic requirements and constraints at the mesohabitat scale (e.g. riffle, runs, pools, glides) are an area of study that may provide insight into factors influencing freshwater mussel distribution and abundance. The objective of this study was to assess simple and complex ecohydraulic requirements of mussels at different mesohabitats during summer low flow conditions using a case-study approach at Grannis Brook, New York. We hypothesized that there would be differences in simple and complex ecohydraulic variables among different mesohabitats and that freshwater mussels will be found in mesohabitats with low relative shear stress (RSS), medium spatial variation of RSS, and little substrate movement. Our Grannis Brook study reach (~110 m) is located at a third order stream reach with a 31.3 km watershed located in the Eastern Great Lakes Lowlands ecoregion.

Along each transect, we sampled for mussels from 1 m² quadrats and measured depth, velocity, substrate type and calculated complex ecohydraulic variables. We will present our findings of ecohydraulic variables among mesohabitats, if we found a relation between mussel density and ecohydraulic variables, and how our findings relate to similar studies.

However, the effects of these changes on land-atmosphere carbon interactions are not fully understood or quantified. By using a combination of historical datasets back to 1970s, 2010s and field observations in 2020s we assessed the biophysical changes in Arctic tundra ponds over the past 50 years. Preliminary data shows that permafrost is thawing and deepening the active layer in open water pond areas while the littoral vegetated zone has increased in biomass and the active layer depth has remained stable likely from the insulation of new soil organic matter. In addition, biomass of the two dominant aquatic plants, C. aquatilis and A. fulva, have increased about ~30% over the past 50 years in tundra ponds. The increase in biomass and deepening of the active layer in ponds have enhanced methane emissions as these factors are the main drivers of methane flux in ponds. By using a sub-meter landcover map, we were able to highlight the importance of small-scale aquatic ecosystems on the regional methane fluxes.

Commercial crabbing is the third largest fishery in the state, and recreational crabbing is a popular pastime among residents. The Maryland-style four-funnel crab pot is a popular choice for crabbers due to its passive and efficient ability to collect blue crabs. A drawback of this trap style is that the potential for bycatch is relatively high compared to other capture methods. The diamondback terrapin Malaclemys terrapin is an estuarine turtle native to the east coast of the United States. Diamondback terrapin is listed as a species of concern in Georgia and are commonly caught as bycatch in crab pots. The present study aims to determine if bycatch reduction devices designed for diamondback terrapin significantly affect the catch of legal-sized blue crab. Field and laboratory studies were conducted to test the effectiveness of two bycatch reduction devices of different sizes. The first BRD is a smaller design with the dimensions of 5.1-6.4 cm x 7.5 cm, and the second is a larger design that is 5.1 cm x 15.2 cm. During a field study conducted from April 20, 2021, to June 18, 2021, a total of 347 blue crabs were captured, and neither bycatch reduction device had a significant effect (p&gt;0.05) on carapace width and length of legal-sized blue crab caught. However, both BRDs significantly (p&lt;0.05) lowered the catch per unit effort of legal-sized blue crab. The lab study consisted of four trials, and the BRD with the larger opening (B) significantly affected (p&lt;.05) the mean number of blue crabs that entered the trap. The smaller BRD (A) had no significant effect on the size of blue crab captured in the field and no significant effect on passage rate in the lab, suggesting that BRD A can be a viable option to reduce the bycatch of diamondback terrapin in Georgia waters.",13,153,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Coral reefs are one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems on earth. However, they are facing increasing threats from a range of human activities, including sedimentation and algal growth. In this study, we investigate the relationship between sedimentation, algal growth, and the biomass of herbivorous fishes on tropical coral reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia. We used a variety of approaches, including visual fish surveys, sediment traps, and bioassays, to assess sedimentation rates, algal growth, and the biomass of herbivorous fishes. Our results showed a strong negative correlation between sedimentation rates and the biomass of herbivorous fishes, indicating that increased sedimentation can lead to a reduction in herbivorous fish biomass. We also found that sedimentation and algal growth were positively correlated, highlighting the importance of controlling sedimentation rates to maintain the health of coral reef ecosystems. Our study has important implications for coral reef management and conservation efforts. It suggests that reducing sedimentation rates can help to maintain the biomass of herbivorous fishes, which play a critical role in controlling algal growth and promoting coral growth. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the need for integrated approaches that consider the multiple stressors facing coral reefs, including sedimentation, nutrient pollution, and overfishing.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the temporal and spatial variation of grass shrimp abundance in the MCBs using data collected from 1994 to 2017. We hypothesized that grass shrimp abundance is higher in the northern bays than in the southern bays due to higher densities of macroalgae and phytoplankton in the northern bays. Results showed a higher catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of grass shrimp in the northern than southern bays for each month (p &lt; 0.05) from April to October. Grass shrimp CPUE was highest in the spring and lowest in the summer months when the abundance of juvenile fishes is typically at its peak.

The lowest mean CPUE of the shrimp was noted in 1996 (40+1.05SE) and the highest occurred in 2002 (608+12SE). The temporal and spatial variations in CPUE of grass shrimp likely influence their trophic role as major prey for several fish species, predators of meiofauna and small infaunal invertebrates, and as grazers on epiphytic algae on saltmarsh grasses in MCBs.",0,182,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

This change in ocean chemistry has affected major ecophysiological mechanisms in fishes, including the development of otoliths. Changes in otolith morphology have previously been linked to decreased hearing sensitivity in fishes. To investigate the potential of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced hearing loss we assayed Hi-hat (<em>Pareques acuminatus</em>), a tropical soniferous sciaenid species. Sound production and reception are critical to the ecology of sciaenids, which are known model organisms for teleost bioacoustics. In this study, we compared the effects of three pH levels and two temperatures reflecting future ocean scenarios and their natural ambient conditions for two different exposure durations (19 wk and 5 wk). The sagittal otoliths were then extracted, imaged, measured, and analyzed in ImageJ. Three standardized ratios were calculated from the measurements: otolith thickness:fish length, otolith length:fish length, and otolith mass:fish mass.

In the last decade, MHWs have increased in frequency globally, causing devastating impacts on critical coastal marine ecosystems, such as kelp forests on the California coast (e.g., the 2014-2016 “Blob”). Due to their seasonal timing, MHWs pose a major threat to reproduction and early stage life history events for many benthic marine invertebrates. This study investigated the effects of MHWs on the Kellet’s whelk (Kelletia kelletii), an emerging kelp forest fishery species in the Santa Barbara region in the southern California Current System. In this study, we sought to determine if trochophores (2-week-old larvae) of adult whelks exposed to a MHW simulation would show greater larval thermotolerance. Adult whelks collected from Carpinteria Reef, California, were held under ambient conditions in the laboratory and were allowed to mate and lay egg capsules (March - July 2022). Trochophores were exposed to a “ramp-up-ramp-down” MHW simulation: 15°C ramped up to 23°C and back down to 15°C over the course of 14 days. After a MHW simulation, larvae were challenged in 1-hour thermotolerance trials via an aluminum heat block and then scored for abnormal morphology following the acute thermal stress. We observed that at 25.6°C, 72% of the trochophores were normal. However, at 29°C or higher, the majority of trochophores (78-100%) displayed abnormal morphology, and exhibited slower mobility compared to unaffected larvae. These results indicated that K. kelletii trochophore larvae were moderately affected by high MHW temperatures. Future studies on the effects of MHW temperatures on larval development will provide further insight into the extent of larval thermotolerance under extreme MHW events and inform the next steps for sustainable fisheries management of this species.",4,,6/9/23 8:30,6/9/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza A,

Current profilers have been integrated for more than a decade and provide novel insight that can enable more accurate calculations of underwater current velocity. Subsurface currents and their variations in speed have been categorized as a physical oceanographic essential ocean variable within the Global Ocean Observing System Ocean Observations Panel for Climate (https://www.goosocean.org/). The velocity calculations are critical for understanding the transport of heat, salt, passive tracers, and pollutants in global oceans. Additionally, surface currents are a major player in climate, as they are responsible for the transport of water and the regulation of global climate and equal distribution of solar radiation. Ultimately, underwater velocity calculations can allow for more detailed and accurate regional and global ocean numerical models of upper-ocean dynamics. However, due to the large sizes of data and limited measurement platforms, subsurface currents and their velocities are greatly under-sampled in real-time. This research project aims to develop a procedure that efficiently processes large data sets of information collected by autonomous underwater gliders while at sea, enabling data transfer to shore in near-realtime. This process involves implementing an algorithm onboard a Slocum glider through the installation of software on a Raspberry Pi 4, which was found to be the most efficient microprocessor.

However, comprehensive assessments of megafauna communities inhabiting seamounts, including diversity, abundance and biomass are seldom available. We investigated the vertical distribution of epibenthic megafauna over a newly discovered seamount region West of Cape Verde. Utilizing OFOS-dives, calibrated videos were taken as a horizontal transect from the northeastern flank of the seamount, distinguishing between the upper (-1354/-2358m) and deeper section (-2358/-3218m). Taxa were morphologically distinguished, their diversity, abundances and biomasses estimated and related to habitat parameters. Both the upper and lower seamount region hosted unique communities with significantly higher megafauna richness at the seamount’s top. While megafauna abundances differed significantly between the upper and deeper community, no significant differences were detected concerning the estimated biomass. The complete seamount showed a vertical zonation with dense aggregations of cold-water corals dominating the seamount’s upper and colonies of the glass sponge <em>Poliopogon amadou</em> dominating the lower region. Special for our study is that abundance and biomass data are provided for a continuous survey of a seamount down to 3,200m.

Active restoration efforts aim to improve coral reef habitats and rebuild coral communities by out-planting young coral in highly-damaged areas. However, this process often relies on concrete bases made with Portland cement. The manufacturing of cement is a key contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, so coral propagation presently contributes to the destruction of scleractinian reefs via global warming. We examined the larval settlement of a robust coral (<em>Porites astreoides</em>) on a variety of concrete alternatives designed to have lower greenhouse gas emissions than traditional concrete. The goal of our study was to identify a greenhouse gas-efficient concrete alternative that maximizes the settlement of <em>P. astreoides</em> larvae, and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions for potential use in reef restoration efforts. We experimentally examined and quantified the settlement and metamorphosis of <em>P. astreoides</em> larvae on seven concrete tile types. Although average larval recruitment differed among tile types, a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA revealed that these differences were not significant (p=0.23). The variance between tiles of the same composition leads us to recommend at least 10 replicates in future experiments to ensure statistical power to differentiate between materials. Lower greenhouse gas alternative concretes were not significantly better or worse than ceramic tiles or traditional concrete for the settlement of <em>P. astreoides</em> larvae and thus could be suitable for coral settlement.",1,175,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Not all trace elements act as micronutrients, with some metals (Pb and Cd) instead having toxic effects on the marine environment. Studying the distribution of trace metals throughout the global ocean is critical to estimating ecosystem health and understanding biogeochemical processes. Metals can be partitioned into three size classes: soluble, colloidal, and particulate. Dissolved metals (&lt;0.2 um) consist of both soluble (“truly dissolved;” &lt;0.003 um ~10 kDa) and colloidal phases (0.003 – 0.2 um). Colloids are tiny particles that are still small enough to pass through the 0.2 um dissolved filter membrane; they are considered an intermediary between soluble and particulate. The size partitioning of trace metals is important because it impacts the fate and lifetime of different elements, particularly their bioavailability. In this study, the concentration of colloidal trace metals in the central Pacific Ocean is compared to the colloidal composition of trace elements in the South Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans. Seawater samples were collected on the US GEOTRACES GP15 Pacific Meridional Transect cruise conducted along the 152°W meridian of the central Pacific Ocean, from Alaska to Tahiti in Fall 2018.

Many lakes in Western Washington are contaminated with arsenic (As) due to a history of smelting. The sediments in these lakes contain higher concentrations of As than the water column. Prior work found As from shallow lakes is deposited into nearshore sediment, resulting in concentrations similar to deep lake sediments. We hypothesize the physical action of nearshore play may suspend As-contaminated sediments and increase As concentrations in the water column, consequently increasing As exposure through accidental ingestion of suspended sediments. Samples were collected from three lakes varying in As contamination levels. To analyze changes in As availability in the water column, we collected filtered and unfiltered water samples before and after simulated nearshore play. Surface sediment samples were analyzed for grain size and total As. We found a significant increase in As concentration after sediment disturbance in the unfiltered samples but no significant change in As concentration of filtered samples. The results suggest contaminated sediments increase the risk of As exposure during nearshore play due to the addition of As-contaminated suspended sediments. This study provides insight into the potential risks of recreational activities in As-contaminated lakes and highlights the importance of understanding the effects of sediment disturbance on water quality and human health.",3,181,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Oyster farming can modify sediments through deposition of organic and inorganic byproducts. This may alter habitat for infauna, which are prey for the aforementioned animals. This study examined whether oyster farms in Delaware Bay alter organic and inorganic carbon content of sediments and infauna abundance. Surveys were conducted in two paired farm-control plots (90x60 m) across a 1 km stretch of tidal flats. In Spring 2021 and 2022, 156 sediment cores (218x20 mm) were collected to estimate infauna diversity and abundance. In July 2022, 80 duplicate sediment cores (16x20 mm) were collected to determine relative proportions of organic and inorganic carbon across each plot.&nbsp; The effect of farms on infauna abundance varied among taxa and years. Total abundance was significantly higher in the farms in 2022, suggesting a positive effect of oyster farms. Additionally, polychaete abundance was significantly greater in farm plots in both years.&nbsp; Results of a generalized linear mixed effects model indicated significantly higher inorganic carbon levels in farm sediment, but no difference in organic carbon. These results indicate that oyster farms can alter sediment composition and infauna abundance, but further research is needed to determine if there is a direct relationship between sediment composition and infauna.",4,180,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Another serious and growing threat to marine ecosystems is the worldwide decline in shark populations which disrupts marine biodiversity and the maintenance of healthy marine ecosystems. Limited studies have investigated the Red Sea shark population and recent studies have mainly investigated the shark population on the Saudi Arabian side of the Red Sea. Thus, there is an urgent need to research shark populations in the popular tourist destination of the Red Sea. Recent shark accidents in the Red Sea are also poorly understood due to the lack of research on sharks. Our study utilizes environmental DNA (eDNA) isolated along the Egyptian Red Sea coast, in the region of Marsa Alam, in an area known for sharks’ presence and an area known to be deficient in sharks. Water was collected, and filtered on a 0.1 μm filter, and DNA isolation was followed by the amplification of a 171-bp 12S ribosomal fragment of the mitochondrial genome. Sequencing of both the former, and 16S rRNA is currently being carried out. The DNA metabarcoding data will provide insight into the difference in the shark community between the two sites, and its potential relationship with the microbiome.

We used δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N to estimate pelagic C use and isotopic niche size of fish communities in 17 Minnesotan (USA) lakes. Cisco used significantly more pelagic C than all other species. Cisco’s contribution to community niche space was larger than other species but was highly variable across lakes. Subsequent analyses showed cisco's pelagic C use across lakes was relatively consistent at 98% but mean pelagic C use of the remaining fish community varied from 21 to 70%. Pelagic C use by the fish community was negatively related to cisco’s contribution to community niche size and positively to phytoplankton abundance. Thus, in more productive lakes, fish communities consume more pelagic carbon, decreasing the uniqueness of cisco in these lakes. Our results show cisco have high, inflexible reliance on pelagic C, but their contribution to community niche space is highly variable among lakes. Overall, cisco are most unique in oligotrophic lakes, highlighting the importance of preserving coldwater habitats in these systems.",0,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza A,

Environmental RNA (RNA) from water samples has the potential to provide information on their life-history stage as gene expression profiles can differ significantly. In this study we identified and tested potential biomarkers for the larval stage of the blue mussel. The potential biomarkers were tested on blue mussel larvae and adult RNA as well as water samples. We have identified a potential marker that is specific to blue mussels with high expression levels in all larval stages. Blue mussels are economically and ecologically important.

The results from this study suggest that there will be no significant impact on the viability or growth rates of <em>Thalassiosira pseudonana</em> or <em>Pavlova lutheri</em> with short-term (10 minute) exposure to elevated pH. However, when long-term (days) exposure occurs there is a significant decrease in growth rates with elevated pH.

The confinement of the IL may hamper water exchange and seagrass detritus export to the adjacent open ocean, which may result in higher organic matter loading to the sediments, and longer residence time of the water in the IL, accompanied by microbial respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic) that may reduce carbonate saturation level to drive carbonate dissolution and thus TA elevation, thereby forming such a unique diel pattern in carbonate chemistry (i.e. a “super” blue carbon factory). These findings highlight the importance of considering TA production through metabolic carbonate dissolution when evaluating the potential of coastal blue carbon ecosystems to buffer ocean acidification and to absorb atmospheric CO2, which provide a very valuable theoretical proposition for conserving and restoring seagrass meadows as a promising strategy for climate change mitigation.",0,188,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Normalized by area, fjords have the highest carbon burial rates than any other coastal system. This is partly because bottom waters can undergo anoxia, a condition that favors preservation of organic matter but also sustains high fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide. Thus, ongoing changes may make fjords strong emitters of carbonaceous gases. However, gas measurements from these systems remain scarce and budgets are uncertain. We have conducted 20 expeditions to Swedish fjords where we have analyzed water column physico-chemical conditions and performed benthic lander deployments to resolve methane dynamics through time and space. We specifically targeted two fjords with contrasting conditions: the anoxic Byfjord and the oxic-hypoxic Gullmarsfjord. Benthic fluxes were the highest at the deepest sites in Byfjord, supporting high bottom water methane (&gt;5000 nM). Both natural and engineered water mixing events displaced methane-rich bottom waters, enhancing upper water concentrations, and driving high sea-air fluxes. Preliminary data from Gullmarsfjord indicate that freshwater discharges drive higher methane concentrations in the surface and middle water column layers compared to bottom waters. Upscaling of literature fluxes combined with our results suggests that fjords globally may emit up to 1 Tg methane per year. Therefore, despite their small global area, fjords may be hotspots of methane release. Ongoing deoxygenation and global change may enhance methane emissions from fjords.",1,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza A,

Since coastal ecosystems already experience seasonal hypoxia, ongoing deoxygenation is of concern as it could exacerbate GHG-driven global warming, negatively affecting several biological communities. Lake Grevelingen is a saline coastal reservoir with seasonally hypoxic conditions resulting from limited water exchange after two dams were built in the 60s–70s. As such, it offers an excellent opportunity to elucidate the role of oxygen temporal-spatial variability on GHG dynamics. N<sub>2</sub>O stands out among other GHG because of its contribution to stratospheric ozone depletion and its effectiveness in enhancing Earth’s warming. Given the tight coupling of N<sub>2</sub>O production and low oxygen concentrations, coastal margins are expected to be high sources to the atmosphere. However, emission estimates in these areas are highly uncertain and mechanistic understanding on the benthic-pelagic coupling of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes and its potential changes with deoxygenation is still rudimentary. In this presentation, we show the first results of an extensive campaign which combines novel benthic profiling, high-resolution water column and surface water measurements, and floating chamber experiments. We discuss the spatial and temporal variability of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes across the sediment-water-air interfaces in the lake and present a budget which could be used to improve the representation of coastal fluxes in ocean models. &nbsp;",10,186,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In a healthy state, the coastal sea acts a carbon sink, but a degraded state could potentially turn the coastal sea to a source of carbon in the form of emitted carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). However, the carbon budget in the coastal sea is often poorly constrained due to an inadequate amount of available data. A new eddy covariance (EC) flux tower for measuring sea–atmosphere gas fluxes was installed in a semi-enclosed bay in the coastal Baltic Sea in early 2022. The quasi-continuous EC measurements enable for a better-restrained carbon budget. Although the amount of data is limited due to the small magnitude of fluxes and especially the interference of fluxes from land, we are able to obtain flux estimates in three unobstructed sectors around the tower. We report here the preliminary results for CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes between April 2022 and January 2023. The measured mean monthly CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes varied between −0.3 ± 0.4 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (± STD, net sink) and 0.4 ± 0.4 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (net source).

There was a significant (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) difference in the day- and night-time CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from April to October, likely reflecting the diurnal changes in the environmental drivers.

Furthermore, the Amazon River plume is a strong sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2 atm</sub>) in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean, which largely influences the biogeochemical dynamics of the land-aquatic continuum in this region. Anthropogenic activities have a significant influence on the Amazon River and its coastal shelf system, thus a better understanding of the impact on carbon emissions and sinks is required. However, large observational gaps in both time and space restrict process understanding and quantification of this region’s carbon fluxes and budgets. To better constrain the carbon cycle components of the Amazonas shelf system, we combine highly-resolved continuous measurements of partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (<em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub>) with an ocean biogeochemistry simulation of the tropical Atlantic using the MITgcm-Darwin model. Model output shows that the carbon absorbed by the Amazon River plume in the form of <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> increased by 10 µatm from 2016 to 2022. As a response of higher CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, surface-ocean total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon also increase over time. The model also depicts a spatial gradient in the river-to-ocean transition. Model evaluation of these results is presented, but it is challenging due to lack of biogeochemical observations in Amazon River plume region. To overcome this, high-resolution <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> measurements are carried out with a ship-of-opportunity line along the coast of Brazil (Brazilian-SOOP line).

Although the importance of measuring these fluxes is widely recognized, there is a lack of reliable flux data, especially in temperate seagrass meadows. Existing fluxes are often uncertain due to internal site variability, low sampling frequencies, and methodological limitations. We addressed these knowledge gaps by measuring high-resolution <em>in situ</em> CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes over a temperate seagrass meadow throughout the growing season. We evaluated methodological limitations by comparing wind speeds, a variable commonly used for air-water flux estimates, on-site and from regional weather stations.

The Cooling and Shading sub-program of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) aims to determine whether localised marine cloud brightening (MCB) and fogging interventions could be temporary solutions to alleviate stress on the climatically-impacted Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Providing an high-resolution record of coral reef BVOC emissions under a variety of environmental conditions during the summer months is essential to 1) determine the main drivers of BVOC emissions in coral reef systems, 2) make accurate predictions on BVOC emissions under future climate change scenarios and periods of induced MCB and fogging, and 3) predict the influence of future coral reef BVOC emissions on the local climate of the GBR as well as other reef systems around the world. Here we report emission fluxes as well as dissolved and atmospheric concentrations of DMS, MeSH, isoprene and monoterpenes measured from the central GBR using a proton-transfer-reaction quadrupole mass spectrometer (PTR-q-MS) during the 2021-22 austral summer.

Of particular interest is the fate of kelp communities as they are increasingly exposed to these changes. Here, we will present results from laboratory experiments carried out in summer and winter as well as <em>in situ</em> measurements of metabolism. Within the framework of the H2020 project FACE-IT, we performed two large scale mesocosm experiments to assess the response of kelp communities to warming, freshening, and light reduction as well as heat waves.

This review identifies vulnerabilities for different life stages across the whole distribution range of polar cod. We explore the impact of environmental (abiotic and biotic) and anthropogenic stressors on polar cod and identify knowledge gaps constraining predictions. Epipelagic eggs and larvae are more vulnerable to climate change and stressors than adults. Increasing water temperature, sea ice decline, change in freshwater input, acidification, changing prey field, increased competition, new predators, and pollution are the principal stressors that will affect polar cod populations. Detrimental effects are likely to be stronger in regions with advection of warmer Atlantic and Pacific waters. In contrast, polar cod may benefit from ocean warming in colder areas of the High Arctic. The risk from fisheries is moderate and primarily limited to bycatch. Overall, a decrease in suitable habitat and an associated decline in total polar cod biomass is predicted. In most Arctic seas, the relative abundance of polar cod within the fish community will likely fluctuate between cold and warm periods. Regional management measures that recognize the critical role of polar cod are required to ensure that increased anthropogenic activities do not exacerbate the impacts of climate change on Arctic marine ecosystems.

Despite the limitation, spring blooms were evident, possibly formed due to the release of dFe with the melt waters and shallowing of MLD, in areas with partial sea-ice coverage providing shelter from wind-driven mixing.

Here, we have summarized how CC‐affected physical and ecological processes influence the levels of pollutants in Arctic marine biota and food webs. 1) Although global use and regulations of pollutants still are the main drivers for levels in Arctic biota, increased incidents of positive states of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO+) result in the increased long-range transport of pollutants and biomagnification in Arctic food webs. 2) Northward range‐shifting species act as biovectors for pollutants into Arctic marine food webs, leading to elevated levels. 3) Dietary shifts can alter pollutant transfer in the food webs. Reductions in body condition are associated with pollutant increase in some biota. 4) Models are useful for predicting the net result of various contrasting CC-affected processes on pollutant exposures; however, for some parameters, especially food web changes, insufficient data exist to populate such models.&nbsp; Our recent data from the Nansen legacy program in the Barents Sea illustrates the effects of borealisation on pollutant accumulation, seasonality, and food web accumulation, as well as pollutant effects in calanoid copepods in present and future climatic conditions.",5,,6/9/23 8:30,6/9/23 10:00,Sala Portixol 1,

Locations and seasons with high glacial melt run-off experienced a lower carbon throughput (i.e., sum of all carbon flows in the food web) compared to locations and seasons with low glacial melt run-off. This difference was primarily driven by a less intense benthic primary production pathway and in most cases also a lower secondary production.

Volatile SCCPs dominated the contaminant profile in polar cod, which indicated exposure from abiotic long-range atmospheric transport. Less volatile MCCPs dominated in capelin, but were barely detected in seals, and not in polar bears. Low occurrence of MCCPs in the predators indicates low biomagnification or capelin as less favorable prey. Capelin could nonetheless act as biotic transport vector of MCCPs to other Arctic predators.

To evaluate the relationships between surface cover composition (white ice, black ice, and snow-on-ice) and under-ice autotrophic production (chlorophyll-a), controlled experiments were conducted over a 2-year period. Mechanical surface cover manipulation – snow addition, removal, or slushing - was undertaken in a paired pond experiment, alongside 700 L mesocosms. DOC concentrations were manipulated in mesocosms through the addition of a humic acid liquid fertilizer. Snow-on-ice resulted in significantly lower autotrophic production as measured by chlorophyll-α values in pond systems, compared to either white or black ice (snow removed) treatments. Though both ponds became anoxic very quickly after ice-on, the removal of snow did result in some diurnal dissolved oxygen (DO) cycling that was not observed under the snow-on-ice treatment. Additionally, addition of DOC did not result in significant changes to under-ice autotrophic production but did result in decreased DO concentrations.

Climate change enhances the melting of ice, and the transition from ice to water may alter light availability for photosynthesis. Previous studies showed that small peaks in the absorption spectrum of liquid water, due to the vibrations of H<sub>2</sub>O&nbsp;molecules, create large gaps in underwater light spectra. These gaps delineate a series of distinct spectral niches in lakes and oceans, which select for different photosynthetic pigments in different aquatic ecosystems. However, ice has other optical properties than liquid water, with a much smoother absorption spectrum for ice in the photosynthetically active range. Therefore, we investigated differences in spectral niches for photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems with and without ice cover using a radiative transfer model. The model output shows good agreement with field observations of ice-covered areas from the Arctic Ocean, Baltic Sea and Antarctica. The results reveal that irradiance spectra under ice span a continuum of light available for photosynthesis, instead of the distinct colourful niches observed for liquid water. Additionally, ice cover caused a pronounced shift of irradiance spectra to longer wavelengths of about 30 nm in comparison to irradiance spectra under liquid water.

This issue is further amplified by challenges associated with climate warming, which threaten freshwater ecosystems by reducing the duration and thickness of ice cover, thereby emphasizing an urgent need for a more comprehensive understanding of winter ecology.

From ice cover to break up, net benthic metabolism shifted from hetero- to auto-trophic with increasing light and returned to heterotrophic during open water with increased respiration and sediment resuspension.

The OSNAP West Greenland Array (WG array) is a high-resolution line of 13 moorings designed to measure the West Greenland Coastal Current (WGCC), the West Greenland Current (WGC) and the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). The shelf moorings each have ADCPs mounted in tripods on the ocean bottom facing up to capture the full water column flow. Here we investigate the use of a Nortek Signature 100 ADCP (SIG100) equipped with 4 100 kHz beams used for horizontal and vertical velocity measurements and a center beam multi-frequency (70 – 120 kHz) echo sounder used for ice draft measurements deployed at LS3 (190m bottom depth, 59<sup>o</sup> 41.358 N, 45<sup> o</sup> 58.239 W). The SIG100 echo sounder was configured to record a full water column echogram at 0.375m vertical resolution every 20 seconds. The deployment period spanned two years from July 1, 2020 – Aug 27, 2022. However, due to a battery failure, the SIG100 recorded data until Sep 25, 2021. Combined ice velocity and ice draft data were used to determine ice transport across the LS3 mooring location. Here we present methods used to determine ice transport and explore relationship between ice transport at LS3 and other locations along the WG array. We also examine the relationship between biomass distribution observed from the echo sounder as it relates to the presence of ice cover. &nbsp;",4,221,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Snow on ice melts increasing light penetration through ice and causing convective mixing of the upper layers of the water column. Often the effective depth of this mixing is limited to the lake’s surface layers but when combined with a lateral under ice flow from the littoral towards the center of the lake, its effect may be seen at deeper depths too. We studied light-induced convective mixing in the pelagic and littoral zones of a boreal lake in late winter, with the objective to understand how the mixing contributes to the vertical heterogeneity of the phototrophic plankton biomass and production. We show that the hotspots for phototrophic biomass are 1) the ice where the prototrophic community benefits from the light from above and the mixing-brought nutrients from below, and 2) bottom waters (7 m) that receive high biomass of phototrophic algae from the littoral where their growth is induced by the combination of increased light and convective mixing, and that have been carried to the pelagic bottom waters by a lateral density current.Substantial changes take place in lakes in late winter.

OM chemical composition is certainly relevant in this process, yet difficult to describe across the entire OM size continuum from dissolved OM (DOM) to large particulate OM (POM). This is likely needed, however, as OM size likely acts as a master trait, that mediates the retention and transport of OM and selects the target consumer community. At larger network scale, this should give rise to OM size-specific patterns of OM composition in dependence on the dendritic nature of a river network and the diversity of land cover types in its terrestrial matrix. Here, we examined the longitudinal patterns and drivers of OM chemical composition along two river networks differing in topology and land cover. We characterized OM chemical composition by mass spectrometry for DOM and by infrared spectroscopy for individual POM particles. Preliminary results showed an overall less degraded OM in headwaters than main stems and in river sections draining forested sub-catchments compared to those draining agriculture-dominated sub-catchments.

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) consist of POM and of mineral particles. Some, rather recalcitrant, portion of the POM is associated with mineral particles of resuspended sediments whereas another fraction is produced and degraded on a seasonal scale. Analyses of the POM content of SPM along the transition from brackish towards clearer marine waters, or during periods of varying turbidity of a tidal cycle, disclose similar patterns: at high SPM concentrations, variations of the POM fraction of SPM remain small; towards off-shore waters, the POM content becomes highly variable but reveals a nonlinear increase with decreasing SPM concentration. A semi-empirical modelling approach was developed to describe these predominant changes of the POM content as a function of the SPM concentration. A prerequisite for obtaining valuable model estimates is the calibration of the model with field data, of e.g. loss on ignition (for POM), particulate organic carbon, nitrogen (POC, PON), or transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) measurements together with corresponding SPM concentrations. The model can then be applied to independent SPM data, e.g. derived from remote sensing.

However, very little is known about microbial communities in STEs and their drivers.

Groundwater was collected from several piezometers (depths 6-22m) along the entire salinity gradient in two different hydrological seasons.

Results show large spatial variations in prokaryotic abundance and activity following physicochemical gradients, but little seasonal variability. Prokaryote abundance was maximum at the deepest saline layers and lowest in intermediate fresh groundwater. More active cells in saline samples were observed, which coincided with increases in nitrate and ammonium, suggesting microbial transformations of groundwater along STEs. Our results indicate that prokaryotic communities in coastal aquifers are highly heterogeneous in terms of biomass and activity, implying that their role in nutrient transformations will vary throughout STEs and calling for detailed spatial explorations of these key ecosystems.",0,,6/7/23 15:00,6/7/23 16:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Degradation experiments with peatland tDOC and model simulations indicate that the rates of purely microbial and purely photochemical remineralization are slow, but that partial photodegradation greatly enhances the rate of subsequent microbial remineralization.

Heterotrophic metabolism in the beach interior largely relies on dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport and composition, determining the modulation of STEs over terrestrial solute fluxes to the coast. Here, we use the elemental and optical properties of the DOM pool in two nearby, yet contrasting STEs in terms of redox conditions to gain insights on how different oxygenation and OM supply affect the role of STEs in coastal carbon biogeochemistry. Conservative mixing curves using local endmembers suggest that in both beaches DOM removal occurred along the continental groundwater flow path, whereas the upper saline plume was exporting DOM towards the coast. DOM and fluorescent DOM (FDOM) peaked in the salt-wedge, concomitant with the higher residence times. When comparing with its terrestrial and seawater endmembers, the anoxic STE was mainly acting as a net DOM and FDOM source and the well-oxygenated STE as a net sink. A gravel layer in depth at the oxygenated STE enhanced oxygen and land-derived nitrate transfer which, in turn, promoted net DOM and FDOM consumption. In the anoxic STE, the remineralization of the particulate OM accumulated at the surface explains net DOM production, of higher aromaticity and lower molecular weight compared to the oxygenated STE. Thus, particulate OM supply and beach oxygenation largely determines the resulting DOM fluxes from STEs to the receiving waters.",1,,6/7/23 15:00,6/7/23 16:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Here we investigate the proton binding properties of DOM extracted from two distinct points along the Ebro River (NNE of Spain), the second longest and fastest flowing of the Iberian Peninsula.

We used the non-ideal competitive adsorption (NICA) model to describe heterogeneity and biding at equilibrium and account for the impact of ionic strength via the Donnan electrostatic interaction model. We identify potential changes in DOM composition according to variations in 1) the number of chemical groups available for cation binding; 2) the intrinsic proton affinity constants; 3) the chemical heterogeneity.

West Falmouth Harbor (WFH) is a shallow estuary in Massachusetts (USA) that intercepts high-N groundwater discharge from a local aquifer impacted by a wastewater treatment facility. Our early work (2005-09) showed a net import of total N (TN), total P (TP), and inorganic P (DIP) from the coastal ocean during the summer. Import of P from coastal waters was sufficient to maintain N-limiting conditions, and the estuary on average retained the entire, large terrestrial N load plus additional N from the adjacent coastal waters (Buzzards Bay). This N retention was presumably a combination of seasonal storage and biogeochemical processes.&nbsp; Since 2010, there has been a significant loss of eelgrass habitat in the harbor. Between 2014 and 2019 we again measured summer season nutrient fluxes and found a continued net import of DIP, but a change to a small export of TP and a significant export of TN from WFH. Examining the incoming and outgoing tide data revealed that the concentrations of N and P in coastal waters that daily enter WFH have decreased, perhaps related to changes in N.

For arid and semi-arid landscapes, climate-induced changes in ionic strength and composition are often complex and depend on local geology, hydrology, and land use. This complexity limits our capacity to predict where, when, and why aquatic ecosystems in arid regions undergo salinization. Here, we present a survey of 53 Canadian lakes across arid (2004) and wetter (2013) years. We contrasted within-lake changes in salinity, major ions, limnological features, and isotopically-modelled hydrological properties among the surveys. The ratio of evaporation to inflow (E:I) increased in the dry year in most lakes (87%), with a corresponding increase in salinity, dominated by SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Na<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>and Mg<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;ions. Generalized additive models showed that E:I and drainage area were the top predictors of lake salinity, while metrics reflecting land cover, soil features, and land use were of secondary predictive importance.

Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are structural devices, such as retention ponds and constructed wetlands, used to control stormwater runoff from developed landscapes. One of the main pollutants found in stormwater runoff is nitrogen. Nitrogen is a macronutrient that limits primary productivity. In excess quantities, introduced nitrogen can lead to coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and coastal hypoxia. Although SCMs tend to be highly effective at removing particulate-associated pollutants, such as phosphorus, they are often much less effective at removing nitrogen. In this research, we aim to provide an estimate of nitrogen removal rates (denitrification) across a series of SCMs along a vegetation gradient. It is hypothesized that SCMs with more vegetation remove greater amounts of nitrogen compared to unvegetated SCMs (e.g., conventional stormwater retention ponds) because organic material provided by vegetation is a substrate for denitrification. We used whole sediment core <sup>15</sup>N-labeled incubations and the isotope pairing method to measure denitrification rates at the center and the edge of several different types of SCMs in Georgetown and Horry Counties, in coastal SC (e.g., conventional unvegetated stormwater ponds, ponds with littoral shelves, constructed wetland). Thus far, we measured higher nitrogen removal rates (up to two orders of magnitude) in the more vegetated SCMs, which supports our main hypothesis. We anticipate results of this research will provide recommendations for improved use of vegetation in SCMs to maximize nitrogen removal and improve the water quality of stormwater runoff associated with coastal development.",2,243,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

While in the open waters this pool is relatively constant, it continuously evolves in the coastal zone with the most prominent changes occurring in the Arctic. Although there are some quantitative estimations of different DOC loads to the Arctic fjords, their fate remains highly unknown. It is still unclear to what extent the DOC entering the fjords is bioavailable and how fast can it be remineralised. Therefore, the following research objectives have been formulated: to assess the lability of the terrigenous and sediment-derived DOC, and to estimate remineralization rate constants and half-life times for bioavailable DOC fractions. This has been done through the 180-days-lasting incubation experiments of soil leachates mixed with surface seawater and sediment interstitial waters mixed with bottom water. For the study site, Spitsbergen fjords have been selected. The results indicate that both the soil leachates and interstitial waters contain a lot of DOC (420-2730 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> and 220-470 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively), which is highly bioavailable – the DOC decay observed during the experiments was 61-66% and 40-60%, respectively. This high lability of DOC indicates that its supply to the water column has the potential to play an essential role in sustaining the bacterial loop in the fjord and, through CO<sub>2</sub> release, in amplifying ocean acidification in the coastal zone.

The primary objectives of this work are the systematisation of existing knowledge on the effects of permafrost thaw on the aquatic system, identification of knowledge gaps and future research needs. The research area is focused on the permafrost regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The obtained findings reveal our poor understanding of the influence of permafrost thaw on the solute fluxes, especially via groundwater discharge, to aquatic systems and the consequences of the delivered fluxes on the biogeochemistry of surface waters. The investigation of aquatic ecosystem structure, functioning, and stability affected by permafrost thawing and associated delivery of solutes to surface waters remains understudied.

In the river, we detected intensive growth of phytoplankton connected with high oxygen saturation and pH values and undersaturation of CO2, whereas concentrations of dissolved nutrients declined. In the estuary, the Elbe shifted from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic system: Phytoplankton died off upstream of the salinity gradient causing minima in oxygen saturation and pH, supersaturation of CO2, and a release of nutrients. In the shelf region, phytoplankton and nutrient concentrations were low, oxygen close to saturation, and pH in a typical marine range. We detected a positive relationship between pH and oxygen saturation and a negative one between pCO2 and oxygen saturation. Flux rates of dissolved nutrients from river into estuary were low and determined by depleted concentrations. In contrast, fluxes from the estuary to the coastal waters were higher and the pattern was determined by tidal current.

This refractory DOM (RDOM) is stable on millennial timescales and contributes to oceanic carbon storage. Dissolved organic sulfur (DOS), as part of the marine DOM, is mainly derived from primary production with contributions of DOS through pore water discharge from abiotic sulfurization in sulfidic environments such as intertidal flat sediments. However, questions remain about the stability of DOS from sulfidic environments once discharged into the water column and how different DOS sources can contribute to the long-term carbon storage as oceanic RDOM. In this project, we use the North Sea as an ideal system for studying DOS formation and fate from various sources, including phytoplankton, porewater as well as riverine outflow, and ultimately, DOS export to the North Atlantic Ocean. Water column and porewater samples were acquired during a research cruise in addition to seasonal intertidal flat, and river sampling (Weser, Ems, and Elbe Rivers). Our quantitative stoichiometric and molecular composition (FT-ICR-MS) analyses of solid-phase extracted DOM revealed non-conservative mixing behavior of carbon-to-sulfur ratios with salinity in the North Sea suggesting export of DOS-enriched porewater from the sulfidic intertidal flats.

Despite this, the fate and distribution of terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) in oceanic systems is poorly understood. We have implemented a theoretical framework for the degradation of tDOC across the land to ocean continuum in a 3D hydrodynamical-biogeochemical model on the North West European Shelf. A key feature of this model is that both photochemical and bacterial tDOC degradation rates are age dependant constituting an advance in our ability to describe carbon cycling in the marine environment. Over the time period 1986-2015, 183 Gmol yr<sup>-1</sup> of riverine tDOC is input to the shelf. Results indicate that bacterial degradation is by far the most important process in removing tDOC on the shelf, contributing to 73% (133 G mol yr<sup>-1</sup>) of the total removal flux, while 21 % (38G mol yr<sup>-1</sup>) of riverine tDOC was advected away from the shelf. Explicitly including tDOC in the model increased the air-sea carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) flux by 111 Gmol yr<sup>-1 </sup>(4%), an amount approximately equivalent to the CO<sub>2</sub> released by the UK chemical industry in 2020. Overall, 61% of riverine tDOC input to the shelf is outgassed as CO<sub>2</sub> while approximately 19% is incorporated into the foodweb.

These ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) are especially important in mediating nutrient cycles within estuaries and near-shore coasts – both dynamic, high-flux aquatic systems. Previous work has shown that marine AOA “bloom” each summer along the Georgia (USA) coast, increasing in abundance 10-1000X and comprising up to 10% of all microbial transcripts. This annual AOA bloom extends along most of the southeastern USA coastline and decouples nitrification – as ammonia oxidation outpaces nitrite oxidation, nitrite accumulates in the environment for weeks. Preliminary data suggests ammonia oxidation rates are influenced by tidal stage and season, and can be inhibited by episodic weather (e.g., rainfall). Here we characterize spatial and temporal variation of AOA within the Cape Fear River and coastal Atlantic Ocean in NC, USA, expanding our work to a river-to-ocean continuum. We confirmed the presence of a summer AOA bloom in the coastal ocean, and observed a potential secondary bloom within the tidal-influenced river.

However, the mixing rates and turnover of organic matter derived from marine, deglaciated terrestrial or glacial sources are poorly defined. We characterized changes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) resulting from influx and mixing of fjord water with glacial meltwater (GMW) in two Arctic fjord systems, Kongsfjorden (Svalbard), and Scoresby Sund (East-Greenland). Two independent high-resolution mass spectrometry platforms revealed a transition of DOM along a mixing gradient from glacial meltwater to marine water masses characterized by molecular GMW features. DOM signatures in Kongsfjorden were homogenous, likely due to high mixing rates and relatively low glacial runoff. DOM in the inner fjord waters of Kongsfjorden was more oxidised and less aromatic than in the outer fjord, suggesting a possible lithogenic source. DOM composition of Scoresby Sund strongly correlated with the salinity gradient, indicating significant terrestrial impact characterized by low nitrogen content, high aromaticity, a low degradation index, and a high terrestrial index. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Scoresby Sund GMW followed a conservative mixing model. DOC below the freshwater lens was enriched relative to the model, possibly due to primary production. Contrary, DOC below the mixing layer was depleted. Aromaticity in surface glacial water was higher than expected from conservative 2-endmember mixing, suggesting either influx or production of these compounds.",3,,6/7/23 15:00,6/7/23 16:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

A KERGUELEN ISLAND CASE STUDY,"Biogeochemical processes in the Southern Ocean (SO) are crucial for global ocean balance. Being the largest high-nutrient-low-chlorophyll region, surface waters in the SO hold a large potential for biological activity, in particular carbon dioxide drawdown and the “greening” of the SO. But these biological processes are limited by the essential nutrient iron (Fe). The accelerated melting of glaciers in the SO could be a significant source of Fe but whether this glacial Fe is bioavailable to microorganisms is inadequately understood. Answering such questions is vital for a better understanding of the influence of glacial Fe on marine microbes and their contribution to the carbon cycle. One pathway of interest is siderophores, low molecular weight compounds that can strongly bind to Fe in seawater and thereby render Fe bioavailable. In this study, we provided colloids obtained from lakes that were influenced or not by glacial melt to SO coastal marine microbial communities. Taxonomic profiling displayed significant differences in microbial community compositions between treatments, with known siderophore synthesizers contributing for about half of the relative abundance in incubations amended with glacial-lake colloids. Furthermore, Fe-related gene annotation analyses showed a higher relative abundance of siderophore synthesis and transport genes in these incubations. This indicates that natural bacterial communities can utilize siderophores to access Fe from glacial nanoparticles hence exhibiting different metabolic responses to a novel resource of Fe in the SO.",20,247,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

These flocculation and aggregation processes occur due to the increasing salinity and pH towards the open sea. The role of pH is particularly relevant in the context of acid sulphate soils that can generate extremely low pH conditions and high soluble trace metal concentrations in river waters. We examined the flocculation dynamics with a series of experiments where natural river water draining acid sulphate soils was mixed with artificial seawater to simulate freshwater-seawater gradient in estuaries. The study focused on the changes in particle size distribution, optical properties of dissolved organic matter and behavior major metal elements. The humic-like DOM fluorescence showed inverse relationships with concentrations of organic-bound particulate Al and Fe, and particulate organic carbon, indicating co-precipitation of humic-like organic matter and dissolved metals. We also identified two major, distinct particle pools pertinent to the flocculation process: the finer classes (9-11 µm) showed low initial volume concentrations until salinity 1, while the coarsest classes (&gt;150 µm) showed a strong initial increase that leveled off and turned to decrease at salinity 2.

Simultaneous measurements of pelagic assimilatory and benthic dissimilatory processes in combination with quantifying riverine loads allowed us to depict a complete budget of seasonal NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> cycling in the largest European lagoon (Curonian Lagoon, SE Baltic Sea). The specific NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> transformation pathway was driven by the seasonal availability of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> in the water column. In spring, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> was in excess and the dominant N form in the water column fueling both pelagic and benthic processes. Deep light penetration illuminated half of the lagoon water column and sediment, and sustained photosynthetic activity, thus affecting benthic processes. In summer, a decrease in riverine loads resulted in lower NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> concentrations, which affected only benthic processes. Whereas pelagic assimilation rates were maintained by active organic mineralization coupled with nitrification. Together, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> processes can retain up to ~70 % of the total N load.

Yet, our knowledge on how DOM stoichiometry influences in-stream C and N processing is far from complete. To assess the role of DOM stoichiometry (i.e. C:N ratio) as a driver of stream aerobic metabolism and N uptake, we performed constant-rate additions of resazurin and ammonium, with and without a co-release of acetate, in 17 headwater streams of five biomes. The streams showed contrasting concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC; 0.5⎼30 mg C/L) and dissolved inorganic N (DON; 0.008⎼0.5 mg N/L), resulting in a wide range of DOC:DON ratios (from 5 to 201). For each release, we calculated in-stream ammonium and acetate uptake, and analyzed heterotrophic activity based on resazurin transformation. Under ambient DOC conditions, DOC:DON ratio was not related to global patterns of heterotrophic activity. However, DOM stoichiometry explained 32% of the variability in in-stream ammonium uptake velocity, with higher values observed in Arctic streams holding high DOC:DON ratios. When acetate was co-released, both heterotrophic activity and ammonium uptake generally augmented, with larger increases occurring in streams with higher acetate uptake rates. In this case, DOC:DON ratio explained 15% and 50% of the variability in heterotrophic activity and ammonium uptake, respectively.

In the upper sand layer, particulate OM (POM) is retained and degraded by bacteria under predominantly oxic conditions. However, seasonal inputs, morphodynamics and POM filtration assume a highly variable and patchy distribution of degradation rates with so far unknown effect on the redox state of deeper layers. Within the interdisciplinary research project DynaDeep, we investigated the seasonal oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) dynamics down to 1 m depth along a sampling transect in the infiltration zone on Spiekeroog Beach (Germany). We carried out a two-monthly year-long sampling campaign including high spatial resolution measurements of sedimentary O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In summer, O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates were up to 90 µM * h<sup>-1</sup> with a 10-fold decline within the first decimeters, indicating efficient retention of reactive POM in the surface layer. Due to morphodynamics, this reactive layer was occasionally buried to greater depths, causing secondary peaks of rates in the subsurface.

Growth of computing resources had already greatly helped the discipline of coupled land-ocean-atmosphere regional models to evolve over recent years. But many challenges remain to be tackled and land-ocean continuum modelling is one of them. Indeed, the kilometre-scale regional coupled prediction approach, especially when coupled with biogeochemistry, has a lot of progresses to achieve in terms of solving coupled physical- biogeochemical processes in the different components and interactions between them. This project aims to quantify the multi-scale interactions along the river-estuary-ocean-atmosphere continuum from hourly to multi-annual time scales over the Scheldt-North Sea region. In particular, we will assess how the physical and biogeochemical dynamics of the North Western Continental Shelf (NWCS) (i.e. limited by the 200m isobath) and Southern Bight of the North Sea (SBNS) are influenced by the small-scale variability of the Scheldt river-estuary and the atmosphere. For solving the multiscale interactions along the land sea continuum, we propose to develop a modelling framework, coupling unstructured (finite-elements) and structured (finite-differences) grid models for fully resolving in three dimensions the continuum of scales and processes from a few hundreds of meters up to several tens of kilometers. For the atmosphere, we will assess the impact of atmospheric forcing resolution provided by the regional climate model MAR on the quality of ocean prediction over the NWCS. Simulations coupling in 1-way will be done to assess the impact of weather events (e.g. storms, heat wave) on the ocean physics. From a biogeochemical point of view, the modelling system developed will offer an optimal way to quantify the transfer of organic and inorganic materials (e.g. suspended particulate materials, SPM) from the land to the sea and to track pollution events.",28,244,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Sediment samples were collected in the dry and wet seasons at four mangrove sites along an estuarine to marine gradient. The main microbial phyla were <em>Proteobacteria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Desulfobacterota</em>, and <em>Chloroflexi</em>, regardless of season, site, or depth.

At the same time, mussels store nutrients in their tissue that are removed from the system through harvesting. However, increasingly development of suspended bivalve aquaculture in the coastal zone also comes with a price as the ecological carrying capacity of the ecosystem may be exceeded. The aim of the present study is to support future fjord-management by estimating the nutrient budgets and ecological impacts of intensified mussel aquaculture in a shallow semi-enclosed system, the Limfjorden, using 3D ecosystem modelling. Model results showed a net removal of nutrients by suspended mussel cultures at basin scale, whereas at farm scale the efficiency was lower due to increased sediment fluxes. An increase in mussel farming from the current 4 kt-fresh weight to a future projection of 104 kt- fresh weight did not exceed the ecological carrying capacity with respect to impacts on sediment chemistry but could cause local declines in benthic bivalve populations. Intense mussel farming provided ecosystem services such as better oxygen conditions and higher Secchi depth together with lower nutrient- and chlorophyll a concentrations on basin-scale. There was a redistribution of nutrients, chlorophyll a concentrations, and Secchi depth between sub-basins in the fjord depending on farming location and intensity. Overall, intensified mussel farming could contribute to the mitigation of eutrophication effects by removing nutrients from land sources and by reducing the local sediment loading.",6,238,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Dothideomycetes are the main fungi responsible for protease and CAZyme activity in the surface layers, whereas Leotiomycetes dominate in the mesopelagic realm. Fungal CAZyme and proteases gene abundance, diversity, and expression increased with increasing depth. This contrasts with the total occurrence of prokaryotic peptidases and CAZymes which are more uniformly distributed in the oceanic water column, suggesting potentially different ecological niches of fungi and prokaryotes.

We used experimental incubations to explore nitrate uptake kinetics in 8 Mediterranean headwater streams draining different land uses and showing large variation in DOC reactivity and DOC:nitrate stoichiometry (molar ratios from 1.5 to 750).

While stream water showed large differences in microbial community composition, enzyme activities, and DOM composition and reactivity, none of these factors substantially shaped nitrate uptake rates across study sites. In contrast, DOC:nitrate ratios explained 40% of nitrate uptake across streams, with uptake rates increasing with increasing DOC:nitrate ratios. Our results suggest that the capacity of stream heterotrophs to take up nitrate from the water column largely depends on resource stoichiometry, and thus, natural or human-induced changes in the relative availability of DOM can strongly influence the potential of headwater streams to deal with nitrate excess.",5,,6/8/23 15:00,6/8/23 16:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Further, these Mediterranean streams have a low capacity to reduce dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) excesses. We hypothesize that a low availability of labile carbon (C) can limit the heterotrophic activity of these streams; and thus, we expect that an increase in labile C will decrease DIN and SRP concentrations by promoting in-stream heterotrophic activity. We tested this hypothesis by adding a brewery by-product, as a source of labile C, to a WWTP-receiving stream and examining its effects on DIN (ammonium and nitrate) and SRP concentrations. We ran a 4-day C addition in a 180 meters reach of a forested headwater Mediterranean stream in July 2022, when 100% of the discharge was sourced by the WWTP effluent. We collected hourly water samples along the reach before and during the C addition. Diel oscillations of ammonium and nitrate concentrations together with longitudinal changes of both DIN and SRP forms during background conditions, suggest a high in-stream bioreactive capacity controlling nutrient concentrations. The in-stream capacity to process nutrients increased during the C addition, and the stream even shifted from being a source to a sink of DIN. Our results support the idea that the capacity of WWTP-receiving streams to mitigate nutrient loads is limited by the availability of labile C sources.",1,,6/9/23 15:00,6/9/23 16:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Land use intensification can alter microbial communities through its effects on soil and water quality, yet such effects have rarely been studied in cultivated floodplains. This study explores how microbial communities in soil and water varies along a perturbation gradient from intensive agricultural land use to cultivated grasslands to natural wetlands. To that end, we studied the composition, alpha, and beta diversity of microbial communities in Lac Saint-Pierre, the largest freshwater floodplain in Quebec, during both flooded and summer (dry) conditions. eDNA was sampled multiple times in 30 fields from four regions of the floodplain. A multi-marker metabarcoding approach was used to characterize bacteria, protist, and fungi communities. We found that each facet of diversity (alpha, beta) and each microbial group responded differently to land use, outlining the need for multi-marker studies in microbial ecology. Moreover, there was a clear contrast between soil and aquatic communities; soil communities were more influenced by local land use, while aquatic communities were mostly structured by regional effects, indicating that water flooding over land under different land use types can mix over moderate spatial scales, masking local effects. These results point towards the importance of studying microbial communities from a multitaxonomic perspective and show the need for large-scale studies across seasons to understand the dynamics of floodplain communities.",5,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

In Arctic ecosystems, strong top-down controls by herbivory may play a role in these land-water connections. For example, grazing by large mammals can change vegetation cover and nutrient pools, and cyclic outbreaks of rodents and insects cause landscape scale disturbances. Yet, whether these perturbations are propagated to recipient streams and lakes remains unexplored. Here, we use monitoring data on aquatic biogeochemistry and herbivore populations, large-scale reindeer exclosures, and remote sensing products, to test the effect of terrestrial herbivores on aquatic biogeochemistry in Scandinavia and Greenland. We find that years after rodent outbreaks are related to elevated export of OC and nitrogen (N) to streams, as well as a high N:P ratio in lakes. Outbreaks of the moth (<em>Epirrita autumnata</em>) suppress catchment productivity and are linked to similar increases in lake N:P. Finally, ponds and streams draining landscapes intensively grazed by reindeers have a higher OC, N and P concentrations relative to streams with reduced grazing. Collectively, our results highlight the potential for terrestrial herbivores to shape the export of essential resources to Arctic aquatic ecosystems, either by directly disturbing soils and vegetation, or indirectly by suppressing terrestrial productivity and thus demand for nutrients.

Heavily impacted by eutrophication (autochthonous and allochthonous inputs), these ecosystems are hotspots of microbial biodiversity and elements cycling, thus, they are considered as environmental sentinels of global change. Besides the phytoplanktonic autotrophs compartment, which is well described in lake ecosystems, the functional importance of heterotrophs (bacteria, archaea) remains unclear and rarely considered in the lakes’ ecology. Here, we carried out a spatial and time-series analysis to investigate the impact of eutrophication and seasonality on the pelagic microbiome at a local scale by coupling 16S rRNA metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomic approaches. We focused on 9 peri-urban lakes selected across a eutrophication gradient, sampled monthly in the Île-De-France region (France). Trophic status and sampling month, more than geographical distances between lakes, shaped the microbial community composition. Microbiome taxonomical composition was most dissimilar among hypereutrophic lakes. Taxa belonging to the Verrucomicrobiota and Planctomycetes were more abundant in those lakes. Ungoing analysis are exploring the dynamic and diversity of microbial functions related to the main biogeochemical cycles (C, N, P and S metabolism). Connecting functions to taxa will highlight the level of functional resilience and redundancy of these peri-urban aquatic ecosystems.

In particular, agricultural impacts can be hard to identify where land-use change occurs on centennial time scales. Here we quantified the effects of agricultural development by contrasting eutrophication histories in three exceptionally large lakes (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Dauphin) whose catchments differ by two orders of magnitude (980, 88, and 9 x 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Each lake was subject to high-resolution paleolimnological analysis of multiple cores using fossil pigments, cyanobacterial akinetes, stable isotopes, elemental geochemistry, and diatom assemblages. Eutrophication began in all lakes ca. 1900 with the advent of regional agriculture, as marked by increased pigments from diatoms and cyanobacteria and elevated carbon and nitrogen content. Lakes with smaller catchments (Dauphin, Manitoba) remained stable through the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, whereas Lake Winnipeg continued to eutrophy. The greatest changes were seen after ca. 1990 and reflected local land-use practises proximate to each lake; water quality improved in Dauphin Lake, was stable in Lake Manitoba, and underwent an abrupt shift to surface blooms of toxic cyanobacteria in Lake Winnipeg. This study demonstrates that even the largest lakes are impacted by initial agricultural development, but that production trajectories depend on modern land-use practises rather than just legacy effects of disturbance.&nbsp;&nbsp;",2,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

While research focusing on abiotic drivers of cHABs produce inconsistent results related to bloom prediction, there is increasing evidence that biogeochemical processes rendered by the greater aquatic microbial community (i.e aquatic microbiome) influence the development of cHABs, but those biotic factors and processes are rarely considered when studying the impacts of Lake Erie ecosystem disturbances. Here we used high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and qPCR targeting genes involved in N and P cycling to assess the taxonomic and functional diversity of the aquatic microbiome associated with cHAB events along the Thames River-Lake St. Clair- Detroit River-Lake Erie continuum, which represents a strong environmental gradient reflecting land use, and across different seasons. We found that, throughout the year, genes involved in P acquisition and denitrification were in high abundance in the Thames River and Lake St. Clair, but decreased in abundance in Lake Erie. There were changes in the dominant cyanobacterial genera along the water continuum from April to October, and their relative abundance successively correlated with different genes involved in P or N cycling.

Effects of pine plantations on stream communities are still unclear, possibly derived from the presence or absence of other plant species in the surroundings of streams flowing through plantations which may buffer such impacts. For instance, N-fixing alder species are usually considered key species. Here, we aim to assess whether the inputs of black alder (&lt;em&gt;Alnus glutinosa&lt;/em&gt; L.) litter to streams counteracts negative plantation-derived effects on stream communities. For that purpose, we used 13C and 15N values of common aquatic invertebrates and their potential sources of organic matter (autochthonous: epilithon; allochthonous: leaf litter, fine particulate organic matter) coming from 6 headwater streams located in Sierra Nevada (southeastern Spain) differing in the presence of alder in their riparian areas. We expect (i) a consistent dominance of allochthonous trophic bases in streams with riparian alder, with an increasing importance of autochthonous resources in those lacking alder; and (ii) that the presence of riparian alder will lead to longer food chains.

As climate change warms the region, an increase in terrestrial organic carbon, i.e. brownification, is expected to alter pond habitats.

Eighteen mesocosms were established in 300-L cattle tanks near three perennial ponds in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. Using a factorial design, mesocosms were treated with deciduous or coniferous leaf litter crossed with a browning agent (i.e., humic acid). Ponds and mesocosms were sampled weekly for five weeks to examine zooplankton community and ecosystem changes. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and nutrients were measured weekly. Dissolved oxygen declined in browning treatment mesocosms, with the lowest dissolved oxygen levels in the browning and deciduous treatment combination (mean 2.96 mg/L, mean control of 8.28 mg/L). Total organic carbon after three weeks in mesocosms averaged twice as high in deciduous and browning-treated mesocosms compared to deciduous treatments alone and six-fold higher than the untreated controls, with coniferous mesocosms slightly lower than deciduous.

Overall, results indicate that fire-driven changes can alter the processing and subsequent export of materials from burned tropical watersheds.

Hazardous amounts of reactive nitrogen can be delivered downstream following storms and degrade water quality. Coastal habitats are known to be effective at removing nitrogen through denitrification (DNF), thus conferring resilience. Less is known about DNF in urbanized environments and response to acute disturbances. We quantified DNF in flooded urban and natural habitats in the upper Neuse River Estuary, NC, USA under two nitrate concentrations (16.8 and 52.3 µM). We also determined how precipitation and wind characteristics of tropical cyclones affect nitrate concentrations and consequently DNF by flooded habitats. All habitat treatments showed net DNF under low nitrate conditions and increased DNF under elevated nitrate conditions—structured habitats with high sediment organic matter had the highest nitrogen removal capacities. Differences in processing demonstrate the importance of natural ecosystems for maintaining water quality and suggest that abundance of habitats within floodplains can influence landscape-scale nitrogen removal. Furthermore, high precipitation-high wind events produced nitrate concentrations significantly lower than other types of storms, which likely resulted in lower removal percentages of dissolved nitrogen loads. High precipitation-high wind events are expected to occur more frequently with climate change, and our data suggest that a regime shift in tropical cyclone activity could result in lower nitrogen removal efficiencies by flooded coastal habitats.",2,,6/9/23 8:30,6/9/23 10:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Upstream land use can have downstream consequences on the water chemistry as well as the microbial community in inflows and lakes. There is a knowledge gap in the interplay between the factors that govern water quality. For example, what allows <em>Legionella </em>to thrive in environmental water is largely unknown. In this study of five Swedish lakes, their inflows and surrounding land use, we show that: I) In the inflows, even though the changes in chemistry were small, land use influenced 27% of the most abundant bacterial taxa. II) Inflowing bacteria affected the microbial composition in the lakes, at times considerably. III) No direct correlation could be detected between land use and the most abundant bacterial taxa in the lakes. IV) <em>Legionella </em>was abundant and increased in frequency with presence of pasture, fields, farms, aluminium, iron and humic substances. Since land use affected bacteria in the inflows where pathogens can naturally occur, and inflowing bacteria affected the lake composition, indirect effects of land use on the downstream water quality should be considered. For clean water access, it is therefore important to consider upstream land use and inflows even when no direct effect can be observed chemically or by indicator bacteria.

The N cycle is regulated by multiple factors, including water salinity. A significant proportion of the world's saline rivers occur naturally and are geographically widespread, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. A large number of streams could become saline as a consequence of secondary salinization that represents a growing problem on a global scale. By studying natural saline streams, we examined the effect of salinity on the relative concentrations of N-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>and N-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, as well as its implication in the net nitrification (oxidation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and ammonification rates (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> production) under laboratory conditions.

A major part of freshwater input (80%) is controlled by a dam situated at 110 km from the estuary mouth. Temporarily high discharges can result in extreme turbidity events, while prolonged low river discharge leads to lower turbidity and higher salt intrusion into the estuary. We studied two sites in the estuary during three years with different dam discharge regimes and evaluated how these changes in environmental conditions affected phytoplankton composition, biodiversity and productivity. A prolonged period of low river discharge resulted in two chl a peaks in summer when normally only one peak is observed. It also led to a higher biodiversity and to the dominance of a previously undetected green alga. Normally, pennate diatoms comprise a considerable part of the phytoplankton, indicating that microphytobenthos may significantly contribute to the water column community.

However, most of the studies have focused on terrestrial systems due to the clear link with human land use impacts. Freshwater studies focused on lotic systems also considering the impact of dams but seldom considering lentic systems. Furthermore, when referring to aquatic landscapes we must acknowledge the interconnection among them and their shared diversity. In this work, we explore the potential trends in diversity in response to freshwater degradation across Europe. Satellite information was used for estimating European waterscapes. Based on this initial layout, we simulated diversity patterns with a coalescent model that considered main European ecoregions as working units and nine dispersal abilities representing different organisms’ interaction with waterscape. Then, we generated a gradient of waterscape degradation scenarios systematically removing a percentage of habitats and recalculating their corresponding diversities. Overall, for each ecoregion, dispersal ability and degradation scenario we obtained theoretical gamma diversity values. Using this information, we analysed degradation patterns by calculating the diversity loss rate and the acceleration rate, which described the simulated diversity decay pattern. We mapped these two parameters across ecoregions and related them with continental scale predictors. Large differences were observed between ecoregions with some of them rapidly collapsing and others being more resistant to waterscape degradation. Such information will contribute to management of freshwater biodiversity at broad scales, improving adaptation and resilience to human-derived changes.",4,,6/9/23 8:30,6/9/23 10:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Microbial community structure was also distinct across the basin, with the alpine sites containing the highest relative abundance of unique species and the urban and agricultural sites being the most similar. Redundancy analyses highlighted the importance of water chemistry and land use (29% and 19% variance explained, respectively) in determining microbial community composition across the NSRB.

Generally, an evaluation of the impact and health risks associated with urban pollutants is deciphered from a single timepoint collection during post-event sampling even though this approach does not match the dynamic nature of landscape contributions to the river. In an effort to better understand the timing and potential coupling of regulated pollutants, we used high-frequency time-series sampling and microbial community characterization to evaluate the sources and linkages between sediment and fecal pollution in an urban watershed. Samples were collected at a single location for 13 separate events across two years, including 11 precipitations periods and two dry weather periods. High-frequency sampling (&lt;4 hr timescale) revealed that fecal bacterial indicator and total suspended solids concentrations were not tightly coupled across storm hydrographs, which indicates unique pollution source origins. We also characterized the microbial community with 16S rRNA gene sequencing and then partitioned the resulting amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) into source environments for sewage, sediment, and freshwater. These data indicated the microbial community undergoes rapid member displacement over short (2-4 hour) timescales. During heavy rain events, &gt;20% of a community’s identified ASVs could be newly arrived between sampling intervals, and these organisms were generally associated with upstream sediment and downstream urban sewage pollution.

At present, measures to reduce nutrient loading to aquatic systems are widely predicated on the assumption that in the absence of sewage inputs, agricultural sources, particularly those that persist in the catchment as legacy P, are the primary control. For example, landscape export coefficient models assign particularly high values to arable land, implying that fertilizer application rates are a key control.&nbsp;Long duration records of lake water total phosphorus (TP) offer a solution; by comparison with historical records of potential drivers, assumptions over the relative importance of each source can be tested. However, most directly measured TP records are not long enough to enable this. Here, lake sediment-inferred TP records (SI-TP) offer an alternative. We combine a 200-year SI-TP record from Crose Mere, a small eutrophic UK lake, with historical land-use data to test the assumed dominance of arable P sources in the lake P budget. We find 20th century chemical fertilizer usage has no direct influence on TP trends, highlighting the canonical assumption about the role of chemical agriculture in driving freshwater eutrophication need not be valid. This paves the way for a critical analysis of eutrophication drivers, and a recognition that export coefficient models cannot reliably use single values to represent arable land. This approach enables the impact of land use change on the lake P cycle to be quantified, bridging the terrestrial-aquatic divide.",2,,6/9/23 15:00,6/9/23 16:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

To this end, we sampled 24 intermittent and ephemeral streams located at Segura River Basin (SE Spain) during the dry phase using pitfall traps. Our findings indicated that spiders showed a higher ability than beetles to detect anthropogenic impacts. Both taxa groups showed habitat-specific responses to human disturbances. While riparian spiders were similar sensitive than those in adjacent dry channels, the opposite responses were observed for beetles. Multimetric indices using the spider in riparian and dry channel habitat communities performed a good classification of the ecological status of the study rivers, contrary to that observed for the coleoptera index.

However, they are vulnerable mainly due to their restricted connection to the sea and the human pressure they are subject to. Mar Menor (SE Spain) is an anthropized coastal lagoon surrounded by intensively irrigated crops. Evidence of its contamination has been reported, including pesticides and nutrients, and although most point to surface runoff as the main conveyor of solutes, groundwater can act as an additional source. However, groundwater estimations differ depending on the method used to quantify it. Since most of the quantifications are based on hydrogeological models, they only consider net freshwater input and ignore water recirculation through the coastal aquifer and sediments, which often are the main source of solutes to coastal systems. In this study, radium isotopes are used as Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) tracers to quantify the total SGD flow to the lagoon and the associated nutrient fluxes, including both freshwater and recirculation fluxes. Preliminary results show a remarkable seasonality in SGD, with maximum fluxes in summer. In addition, estimated fluxes are comparable to surface runoff, suggesting that SGD is an important source of nutrients to the lagoon, especially in summer.

Most studies that include monitoring of streams post-fire are short-term and, by necessity, are designed to examine changes immediately following a fire event, not quantifying long-term or lagged responses to fire. In arid regions, changing fire regimes are coupled with changing precipitation regimes, potentially compounding disturbance signals and endangering downstream water supplies. We propose a conceptual framework describing how linked accumulation, transformation, transport, and propagation processes influence responses to fire in aridland catchments. We tested components of this framework using pre- and post-fire observations of stream chemistry from watersheds in southern California and northern New Mexico which are two areas with differing precipitation regimes. Using a multivariate autoregressive state-space approach, we demonstrate that changes in stream chemistry (e.g., nutrients and conductivity) due to wildfire can be lagged by up to 3-5 years due to intermittent precipitation. Such effects vary between the two hydroclimatic regimes (i.e., Mediterranean vs. snowmelt/monsoonal).

Notably, however, in most limnological studies, only limited attention has been paid to the differences between and peculiarities of the various remote sensing methods and products available. Indeed, a profound understanding of remote sensing methods for inland waters is necessary for their correct application and data interpretation. Due to the optical complexity, biogeochemical and biological variability of freshwater ecosystems, common remote sensing products made for terrestrial or oceanic applications are not accurately applicable in inland waters. Fortunately, given the growing interest in remote sensing of inland waters, capacity-building strategies have been discussed to overcome these knowledge gaps. In this context, it became clear that synergies between remote sensing and limnology communities need to be developed, with the aim to overcome methodological limitations and improve our ability to accurately monitor our rapidly changing inland waters.",2,279,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Despite some important advances regarding the role of spatial feedbacks in structuring terrestrial ecosystems, such observations are lagging in aquatic systems because of the inherent difficulty of assessing their landscape composition and complexity. To investigate the technical capacity of high-resolution remote sensing to fill this gap, we used simulated landscapes to emulate the main sources of remote sensing noise affecting aquatic scenes at multiple sensor resolution and vegetation organisation levels. Multiple informational complexity metrics were then computed over these landscapes to study their behavior across gradients of organisation, resolution, and noise, assessing the limits of their usage in a monitoring context. To ensure the simulated landscapes were representative of natural gradients, simulated noise was also added to real high-resolution remote sensed landscapes to compare the complexity response curves. Preliminary results suggests that some metrics evaluated on very high-resolution images (&lt;5m resolution) are less robust to environmental noise than on high or medium resolution images, while some complexity metrics such as those related to shape tend to perform well across all noise treatments. These findings represent an important step towards studying landscapes complexity changes across time and space and how it affects functioning and resilience.",2,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Menorca B,

In particular, eutrophication and dystrophication are examples of how changes to allochthony or autochthony can lead to shifts in trophic status. Despite being a fundamental limnological metric, understanding the broad spatial and temporal patterns in lake trophic status is limited. To this end, we combined remotely sensed Landsat optical reflectance values with in-situ true color and phosphorus data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Lake Assessment to build classification models of trophic status. We applied those models to 56,000 lakes to conduct the most comprehensive nutrient-color assessment of lake trophic status across the contiguous U.S. from 1984 to 2020. Over the 36 years, we found that most lakes greater than 10 ha are consistently mixotrophic/eutrophic (~55%). While the proportion of eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes has remained relatively constant, the proportions of dystrophic (i.e., brown) and oligotrophic (i.e., blue) lakes have substantially increased and decreased respectively over the last 36 years. This “brownification” pattern is concentrated in the Upper Midwest and Northern Appalachian regions, where interactions among forest cover, lake morphometry, and acid rain may drive lake dystrophication. Together, these results support previous findings, suggesting that while eutrophication is a pervasive water-quality concern, dystrophication is another pathway for lake trophic status change across macroscales.",5,,6/8/23 8:30,6/8/23 10:00,Sala Menorca B,

The origin of Sargassum was estimated not only to the Zhejiang coast of the East China Sea (ECS), but also to the northern coast of the Yellow Sea (YS), which was previously unknown. In particularly, the particles of the northern coast of the YS origin showed two paths that reached Jeju Island and the southwestern part of the Korean Peninsula due to the influence of monsoon and coastal currents in winter, or moved to the ECS and reached by southerly wind in spring. The time of reaching the coast of the Korean peninsula, which varies from year to year, was greatly influenced by anomalous westerly wind in last December. In addition, the anomalous wind field from January to March also determined Sargassum distribution in spring. In relation to the growth of Sargassum, the influence of temperature and the supply of nutrients of human origin released to the coast of China were important. During the period of 2010–2020, the trend of surface temperature on the coast of China and the ECS was about 10 times higher than that of the past 30 years, and 5–6 times the global surface average.

Uncertainty in the parameter values translates into uncertainty in the model outputs. The value of ocean BGC parameters depends on the physical and biogeochemical context of the marine environment. However, they are used as constant values across space and time in the model simulations. To alleviate the latter, this study utilizes the ocean BGC model Regulated Ecosystem Model 2 (REcoM2) to estimate ten selected BGC parameters allowing for the variability of the parameter values across space and over time using an ensemble data assimilation technique.

However, calcite precipitation is heterogeneous in space and time and can be triggered by varying conditions. As a result, carbon fluxes generated by calcite precipitation are seldom quantified at the annual and ecosystem scale. How much they contribute to lakes' carbon cycle remains to be determined. Herein, we combined remote-sensed and ground-based data to machine learning and biogeochemical modeling to quantify the contribution of calcite precipitation to the annual carbon fluxes of Lake Geneva. We first assessed how much inorganic carbon gets precipitated annually in Lake Geneva. We distinguished fluxes generated by continuous background calcite precipitation, as quantified by high-frequency field data, to those from transient whiting events, as estimated from remote-sensing, field-sampling, and machine learning. Results showed that carbon fluxes from calcite precipitation in Lake Geneva reach 20-30 GgC.yr<sup>-1</sup>, &gt;80% due to the continuous background calcite precipitation.

Water levels can fluctuate by several meters and alter stratification, hydrostatic pressure, and oxygenation, that in turn influence GHG emissions. Further, when upscaling emissions estimates to the entire reservoir, changes in surface area due to drawdown are rarely considered.

In order to effectively study these transitioning ecosystems, it is necessary to employ reliable and scalable metrics that can differentiate between marsh and coastal forests. As such, integrating vegetation structure metrics from Light detection and ranging (Lidar) could enhance traditional mapping strategies compared to using optical data alone. Here, we characterized 3 coastal upland forests using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) along a narrow elevation gradient in the Delaware Bay estuary that is particularly vulnerable to SLR. We analyzed the structural dynamics across forest edge-to-interior transects and utilized the comprehensive 3D data obtained from TLS to determine how elevation (i.e., inundation proxy) influenced the vertical stratification and other forest structural characteristics that may be consistently impacted by inundation at low lying elevations. Our findings revealed a consistent pattern between elevation and the Plant Area Index (PAI), a metric that holds potential for enhancing the delineation of complex coastal ecosystem boundaries, particularly in relation to landward marsh migration.",11,280,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Therefore, it is important to determine the distributions of essential ocean variables (EOVs), like temperature and salinity, as well as their interactions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales both in horizontal and vertical dimensions. To achieve reliable ocean observations, <em>in situ</em> and remote sensing platforms have been developed collecting EOVs data at great resolution, and to enable process-based modelling efforts of ocean dynamics. However, the distribution of subsurface ocean measurements is extremely sparse and irregular, which presents a challenge for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the ocean and marine ecosystems. To overcome the limits of sparse temporal and spatial observations, neural networks combining remotely-sensed surface measurements and <em>in situ</em> vertical profiles are increasingly being used to obtain high-quality three-dimensional estimates of subsurface ocean state variables. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for reconstruction of vertical profiles using satellite surface measurements as input collected between 2005 and 2020 in the Atlantic Ocean, and its performance is shown to be superior to current state-of-the-art methods. Different combinations of surface variables are analyzed and compared to determine the key surface variables for ocean structure reconstruction. Furthermore, the relative importance of each of these variables is estimated over the full vertical profiles.&nbsp;",4,281,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Warm temperature anomalies are increasing in frequency in the global ocean with potential consequences on the goods and services provided by marine ecosystems. Recent studies have analysed the distribution and dynamics of marine heat waves (MHWs) and evaluated their impacts on marine habitats. Different drivers can generate those anomalies and the emerging attributes can vary significantly both in space and time, with potentially different effects on marine biology. In this paper we classify MHWs based on their attributes and using different baselines, to account for different adaptive responses in phytoplankton dynamics. Specifically, we evaluate the impacts of the most extreme, long-lasting and high-intensity MHWs on phytoplankton communities using remote sensing data. We demonstrate marginal impacts on total chlorophyll concentrations which can be different across different ocean regions. These contrasting effects on phytoplankton dynamics are most likely the results of the different mechanisms generating the MHWs in the first place, including changes in front dynamics, shallower mixed layers, and eddy dynamics. We conclude that those drivers can also induce different phytoplankton responses across the global ocean.",5,272,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Automated analysis methods for the beach images taken by multi different types of cameras (e.g. aerial drones, webcams, and smartphones) have the possibilities to provide alternative monitoring methods to relatively laborious approaches such as a manual collection and counting of the litter and help us to accelerate to understand the real state of the pollution. As the first step to establishing the method to estimate the total amount of macro plastic litter on the beach, we developed a deep learning model which gives pixel-level image classification to the beach images into eight classes, including artificial litter and natural litter classes. The accuracy of the model was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. The detection accuracy of the model for artificial litter on the test data was around 80%, and the usefulness of the method was demonstrated by comparing the results by projection transform from the ground image inference, and drone image ground truth results. Moreover, now we are attempting to develop a technology to classify macro plastic objects in detailed classes.

We assessed the satellite-observed color of 1086 western US lakes with fires in their watersheds. Color is an integrative measure of water quality that can serve as a proxy for variation in autotrophic productivity, dissolved organic matter, and suspended sediment. We aimed to understand (1) how lake color responds to fire, (2) how long potential changes in lake color persist, and (3) what factors influence the sensitivity of lakes to wildfire. Using a Bayesian changepoint algorithm, we found that ~20% of lakes experienced abrupt changes in color in the years immediately following wildfires, while another ~10% experience more gradual increases or decreases in color. Of the lakes with a color change in the years immediately following fire, about 60% experienced greening while the remaining shifted toward bluer wavelengths. In many lakes, there was a lagged response in color change of 2-3 years after a fire. While most lakes returned to their pre-fire color within 5 years of a burn, not all lakes recovered. We explored how lake response related to lake and watershed characteristics, burn extent and severity, and management status.

First, we studied the role of microbial-mediated protection for species coexistence. Second, we tested if host-virophage interactions evolved towards parasitism.

Microbial communities in hadal sediments are highly diverse and conduct all biogeochemically relevant metabolisms, indicating that extreme hydrostatic pressures in these habitats do not impose evolutionary bottlenecks. Microbial community composition changed gradually over sediment depth and followed parallel downcore succession patterns at six sites along the trench axis, with little compositional dissimilarity between sites. These downcore changes were not associated with organic carbon content nor with microbial abundance. They could not either be explained by concentrations of electron acceptors or donors, or by vertical dispersal of microbes. Instead, changes in selective pressure were associated with the abrupt transitions recorded between redox zones. That sharp transition manifest itself through gradual changes in microbial community composition, indicating a slow response of these microbial communities to changing redox conditions.

Of particular interest is the question of whether the intercepted POC in the deep ocean stems from overlying primary production, i.e., as part of the biological pump, or whether the POC originates from advection and subsequent aggregation of resuspended sedimentary carbon originating from continental margins and other distal sources (Conte et al., 2019). To quantify the intra-variability in PO¹⁴C, a study was initiated at the Ocean Flux Program (OFP) site in the Sargasso Sea. This sediment trap time-series has generated (bi-)weekly samples and measured particle fluxes and compositions at 500, 1500 and 3200 m water depth since 1978. Radiocarbon measurements of POC of all traps spanning 2012-2015 reveal intra-annual variations in PO¹⁴C with an amplitude of ca. 100 ‰. Seasonal Δ¹⁴C variations are paralleled by shifts in Mn, Fe, Al as well as the POC/Lithogenic ratio. This supports the notion that POC with high Δ¹⁴C values, high POC/Lithogenic ratios and POC fluxes reflect supply of particles that originate via the biological pump, while lower Δ¹⁴C values and POC/Lithogenic ratios are indicative of a flux including resuspended sediments with higher lithogenic content emanating from continental margins.

Using a batch culture approach, we investigate the effect of these parameters on the BGE of marine microbial communities from different marine environments. We systematically quantify the effects of temperature and pressure in combination with different dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources on BGE, while varying only one parameter at a time. Our results show that BGE is dynamic, positively correlated to temperature and addition of labile DOC, and regulated by the C and N composition of the added organic carbon sources in both shallow and deep waters. These findings allow us to distinguish between the energy and organic nutrient requirements supporting an efficient transformation of DOC into bacterial biomass. These measurements of BGE regulation across different environmental conditions provide a comprehensive range for BGE values typically observed in marine environments, contributing to our understanding of how microbes adjust their BGE according to environmental parameters.

Instead, trench sediments contain surprisingly reactive organic matter and display high microbial turnover. Strong benthic oxygen consumption and shallow oxygen penetration facilitate extensive anaerobic diagenesis. Reactive organic matter may enter trenches via downslope focusing and seismic-driven mass wasting events, but the extent to which surface-derived sinking particles may be deposited in hadal sediments is not known. We tested the hypothesis that high pressure levels inhibit the metabolic activity and growth of heterotrophic microbes associated with fast-sinking diatom aggregates, with potential implications for organic matter deposition and microbial community composition. Model aggregates were incubated in rotating tanks in which pressure was incrementally increased to simulate the descent of aggregates to hadal depth. The activity of several exoenzymes and community respiration decreased with simulated sinking depth. Accordingly, cell abundance of the carbon-supplying diatoms decreased less than in control incubations at atmospheric pressure. The abundance of most bacterial taxa decreased with simulated depth, while that of only few taxa increased. Exposure to high pressure levels thus reduces degradation processes and reshapes microbial communities associated with sinking aggregates.

The mean values in the bathypelagic and bottom layers were higher and more variable than those in the surface and mesopelagic layers. This variability is mainly due to the horizontal (latitudinal) variation of the ratio. These results suggest that the distribution patterns of viruses and prokaryotes in the central Indian Ocean differ between depth layers. These differences can be attributed to the different mechanisms of reproduction and decay of viruses and prokaryotes. In particular, the latitudinal variation in the ratio in the bathypelagic and the bottom layer (increasing from high to low latitudes) is likely to be explained by the fact that virus particles are less easily removed from the environment (less easily degraded) than prokaryotic cells.",3,299,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Such prophage elements represent a hereditary biosynthetic burden as well as a latent genetic bomb, that can be induced killing the host in the process. However, prophage genes can also contribute to metabolic properties of the host inducing a stable mutualistic interaction between phages and their hosts. Only a few phages-host systems have been isolated from hadal and abyssal environments.

However, most measurements of microbial processes are performed only at atmospheric pressures (0.1 MPa). Hence, the extent to which pressure affects the activities of microbes that either sink as part of the biological carbon pump, or those that reside in the deep ocean, is little understood. To quantify pressure effects on microbial functions, we measured rates of enzymatic activities—the first step in organic carbon remineralization—in waters and sediments collected from shallow to hadal depths. Activities were measured at pressures from 0.1-100 MPa, equivalent to pressures in surface waters down to 10,000 m. Although the magnitude of pressure effect varies for diverse protein- and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, the most common effect is partial activity reduction relative to the rate at 0.1 MPa. On average, activity reduction only exceeds ca. 15% at pressures &gt;25 MPa. Notably, enzymatic activities from abyssal and hadal sediments only show an average reduction of 25% when measured at 100 MPa. Retention of most or all enzymatic function up to 100 MPa is observed at certain sites, but mostly in assays with only cell-free enzymes (i.e., no microbes or cell-bound enzymes). Thus, while hydrostatic pressure generally reduces enzymatic activities, its effect appears to be limited especially in comparison to other heterotrophic process in the carbon cycle, including secondary production and aerobic respiration.",1,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Santa Catalina,

Organic particles sink from the surface ocean into the mesopelagic layer, where most of them are microbially degraded. The behavior and speed of this degradation is dependent on both the nature of the sinking substrate and the microbial community itself. In this experiment, particulate organic carbon (POC) from three carbon-14-labeled algae cultures, i.e., <em>Thalassiosira weissflogii</em>, <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em> and <em>Tetraselmis sp.</em>, were added to mesopelagic water in triplicate carboys and observed over a period of 87 days in sampling intervals ranging from daily to weekly. Samples were taken for POC, total dissolved carbon (TDC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and bacterial abundance. Generally, at least two phases of decay were observed: an initial faster rate in the first 10 days which was followed by a period of slower decay for the remainder of the experiment. There was a significant difference in the decay rates among algal species. However, a similar amount of POC, between 7 and 12% of the initial amount, remained undecayed after three months. Our results support the notion that the initial particle composition matters in the rate of decay and determines how far particulate carbon can sink through the water column before it is remineralized.",6,286,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

These communities, largely dominated by sulfate reducers and methanogens (&gt;1.5 mbsf), experience extreme environmental conditions including high hydrostatic pressure. However, the impact of pressure on microbial activities and the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to life under these conditions are poorly understood. We collected sediment cores from the hadal, abyssal, and bathyal water-depth zones of the Puerto Rico Trench and hypothesize that 1) microbial communities within these samples are adapted to <em>in situ</em> pressure and 2) anaerobic activities proceed at the same rates observed in shallower waters. To assess this, replicate microcosms were established targeting the enrichment of sulfate reducers and methanogens and incubated at atmospheric (0.1 MPa) and <em>in situ</em> pressure (5-84 MPa, equivalent to 500-8400 mbsl). Differential gene expression (DGE) analyses will be performed to identify genes that potentially contribute to microbial adaptation to high pressure. In addition, sediments were incubated with the methionine analog L-homopropargylglycine to determine microbial activity across water-depth and redox zones using bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging. Initial results show that 78 microcosms contain elevated cell counts and sulfide concentrations, suggesting enrichment of sulfate reducers.

These biological hot spots are still sparsely sampled, and our current knowledge is limited to snapshots in space and time. As such, it is still difficult to evaluate concepts of connectivity, resiliency, and redundancy, particularly when considering microbial organisms. In July of 2021, as part of the OceanX Young Explorers Program, we set out to explore the Moytirra vent field north of the Azores, with the goal of characterizing the diversity of organisms inhabiting vent plumes and how community composition and function changes with distance from the vent site. A CTD tow-yo transect was conducted within a plume collecting samples at 200m intervals across 2.4 km. Samples were sequenced using metabarcoding and metatranscriptome approaches to assess the diversity and function of organisms within the plume and how these relate to biogeochemistry and distance from vent origin. We find diverse microbial organisms inhabiting the plume with stable diversity patterns along the transect. Metatranscriptomes displayed active chemosynthetic metabolisms as well as revealed putative viral infections. However, these functional signals became more dissimilar with distance from the vent, suggesting that vent-influenced dynamics on microbial community function decreased with distance while diversity remained the same.

Recent evidence suggests inorganic sulfur oxidation could be a major energy source for deep ocean microbes. However, the global relevance and the identity of the major players in sulfur oxidation in the oxygenated deep-water column remain elusive. In this study we combined single-cell genomics, community metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and single-cell activity measurements.

Low temperature can decrease microbial degradation during descent and enhance the pelagic-benthic coupling of organic material. However, the effect of increasing hydrostatic pressure (HP) on the degradation efficiency of the zooplanktonic organic matter is unclear. In this study, the degradation of carcasses and fecal pellets of the copepods <em>Calanus finmarchicus</em> and <em>Acartia tonsa</em> was experimentally studied as a function of pressure (0.1-100 MPa). The particles and associated microbial communities were incubated at HP in two scenarios: rapid exposure (i.e. immediate pressure effect in 1-day incubations) and gradual exposure at a pressure increase rate of 5 MPa d<sup>-1</sup> (i.e. simulation of the descent through the water column in 20-day incubations). Aerobic respiration and extracellular enzymatic activity were quantified as key steps of microbial carbon transformations. Our experiments revealed no significant effect of HP on microbial respiration until 20 MPa. From 30 MPa, however, microbial respiration was inhibited. In contrast, enzymatic activity showed more variable pressure responses. Based on the varying degrees of microbial activity reduction at increasing HP, the potential amount and nature of zooplankton-derived POC and Dissolved OC reaching the deep sea will be discussed.

However, the lability of the available organic material is critical for the respiratory activity and the growth yield of microbial communities. In this study, we present results from a novel pyrolytic approach called Extended Slow Heating (ESH) that provides detailed information on the thermal behavior of different subfractions of organic carbon. The approach is applied to sediments recovered from undisturbed abyssal settings and perturbed complex hadal trench sediments. Using a mathematical model to analyze the pyrolysis data, we show that subfractions of easily degradable organic material better describe the distribution of microbial communities as compared to TOC, which presumably was dominated by resilient organic material. Our results highlight the limitations of using TOC as a predictor for the distribution of microbial life in deep ocean sediments and emphasize the need for more detailed analyses that characterize the nature of the organic material in order to understand the distribution of microbial communities.

Moreover, there is a close correspondence between dust and Fe deposition records in the SAO on the one hand, and East Antarctic (EA) ice core dust flux covering the last 800 ka on the other, indicating that both archives record large-scale deposition changes.

While phytoplankton indeed internalize dissolved iron and not particles, the actual dissolution scheme may strongly impact bioavailability, and should not be ignored.&nbsp; For phytoplankton to utilize the almost insoluble aerosol-iron, aerosols need to remain in the ocean surface (i.e. time is a factor), and dissolution has to take place next to the cell (i.e. space is a factor). Moreover, microbes employ multiple pathways for enhancing aerosol dissolution (i.e. biology is a factor). Based on accumulated studies by our groups and others documenting mineral-cell interactions and bio-modifications of Fe-minerals by open ocean and coastal phytoplankton, we propose to extend our view on aerosol-Fe availability and re-claim the term “bio” in bioavailability.

To substantiate this concept, I’ll showcase some of our studies with natural Red Sea <em>Trichodesmium<em> </em></em>colonies, unveiling a variety of biochemical pathways and physical mechanisms that assist it mining Fe from aerosols. These colonies actively capture, transport and package dust in their core, thus minimize diffusive losses. <em>Trichodesmium</em>&nbsp;and its associated bacteria act together to solubilize dust, where bacteria secrete iron-binding molecules that promote dust dissolution and<em>&nbsp;Trichodesmium</em>&nbsp;provides dust and optimal physical settings for dissolution and uptake. &nbsp;Such modifications, even if subtle, can lead to elevated fluxes, given time and cell-particle proximity. &nbsp;Thus, biological processes prevailing in marine microhabitats likely affect marine biogeochemical cycles on a large scale and should be considered when referring to aerosol-iron bioavailability in marine environments.",5,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Santa Catalina,

However, significant uncertainties remain in the source apportionment, due to a lack of source-specific evaluation of Fe-laden aerosols. Here, the large uncertainties in the model (IMPACT) estimates are investigated using different Fe emissions from metal production. The best agreement in anthropogenic factor of aerosol Fe concentrations with the field data in the downstream region of East Asian outflow is obtained with the low estimate of smelting Fe emission factors. The simulation with the higher estimates of smelting Fe emission factors indicates better agreement of aerosol Fe bioaccessibility with field data over oceans south of 45°S. Our simulation with the low estimate of smelting Fe emission confirms that anthropogenic aerosols play dominant roles in bioaccessible Fe deposition to the northwestern Pacific, compared to lithogenic sources. Our simulations with higher estimates of smelting Fe emission factors suggest that Fe-containing particles co-emitted with sulfur dioxide from metal production substantially contribute to atmospheric bioaccessible Fe fluxes to the Southern Ocean. These findings highlight that accurate representation of aerosol Fe from metal production is a key to reduce large uncertainties in bioaccessible Fe deposition fluxes to the Southern Ocean.",3,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Santa Catalina,

High ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels by the shoaling of upper mixed layers and increasing atmospheric dust deposition from arid regions may alter the strength of coupling between DOCp and DOCc (measured as the DOCp:DOCc ratio) with consequences for the metabolic balance (PPT:R) of marine oligotrophic ecosystems. We hypothesised that the increased nutrient supply from dust deposition would boost particulate primary production (PPP) and DOCp, exceeding their consumption by bacteria and promoting C storage in the coastal area. The opposite response was expected in the open sea. From the observational study, we developed an empirical model in which the DOCp:DOCc ratio exponentially relates to PPT:R across the SW Mediterranean Sea. In our experiment, UVR×Dust increased DOCp:DOCc by stimulating autotrophic processes (PPP and DOCp) in the coastal area whereas UVR×Dust decreased autotrophic processes and enhanced DOCc through the reinforcement of heterotrophic microbial metabolism in the open-sea area. The incorporation of these findings into our empirical model predicts C accumulation in coastal areas and C consumption in open-sea areas under future UVR×Dust scenarios. The impact of greater dust deposition and higher UVR levels will alter the microbial C-flux with consequences for the productivity of microbial communities at the surface of the sea, its standing stocks, and ultimately, the ecosystem’s metabolic balance.",2,302,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Though direct evidence is still lacking, several lines of inquiry&nbsp;suggest that dust nutrient subsidies lead to aquatic ecosystem shifts and may be driving the loss of pristine, low-nutrient environments. Understanding the effects of dust deposition on ecosystems has been hampered by the fact that traditional monitoring programs focus primarily on particles less than 10 microns, and thus fail to capture to full breath of materials in the atmosphere. Our research has attempted to fill these knowledge gaps through high-frequency temporal and spatial sampling of dust deposition in the American west. Results from 5 years of monitoring indicate that dust deposition rates and composition have marked seasonality with notable shifts in composition along elevation gradients. The experimental addition of dust to aquatic ecosystems revealed shifts in production and community composition. To understand dust-plant dynamics, a controlled greenhouse experiment examined trace nutrient uptake in plants exposed to dust collected from a playa source.

However, it is highly challenging to measure or estimate reliable deposition fluxes of aerosol dissolvable metals in the ocean partially due to the impacts of complicated processes involved in pre- and post-deposition of aerosols. We have collected lithogenic dust from major Chinese deserts and size-fractionated aerosols from the East China Sea (ECS) to study the variations of their dissolvable metals by using three operationally defined leaching protocols (pure water, buffer, and Berger leaches). We have systematically investigated the changes of the distribution patterns of the metals to evaluate the potential impacts of the transport processes on the flux estimates of different elements. In addition to the extremely high solubilities observed for anthropogenic type elements, we found highly divergent variations for the solubilities of lithogenic type elements (e.g., Ti, Al, Fe) with aerosol size fraction by the three leaching treatments. Without knowing the size specific information (mass and solubility), our observations indicate that the deposition fluxes of lithogenic type elements would be significantly overestimated. Compared with the solubility of the desert dust, we found that all solubilities for lithogenic type elements in the largest aerosols were significantly enhanced. For example, the Fe solubilities increased up to 68, 6, and 3 folds for pure water, buffer, and Berger treatments, respectively. Attributed to the difference of the impacts of the transport processes in different regions, the extent of the enhancement would be region specific. Comparing some other recent laboratory studies, we argue that the solubilities obtained by buffer and Berger leaches are more realistic and representative than dissolved leach. Similar field studies in other regions are essential to obtain region specific parameters of dissolvable aerosol metals to achieve better global modeling estimates on the fluxes of dissolvable aerosol metals in the ocean.",0,304,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

This deoxygenation has resulted in an expansion of tropical oxygen deficient zones (ODZs; Stramma et al., 2008), potentially altering both the habitable zones of marine organisms and rates of biogeochemical transformations. Remineralization is a key process controlling the volume of the ODZs. Remineralization is represented in all CMIP6 models, but the actual parameterizations, as well as their magnitudes, are widely varying. Here we examine the sensitivity to remineralization of the equatorial Pacific in the NASA-GISS climate model. We find a near-linear, negative relationship between ODZ volume, onset depth, and thickness and remineralization rate. These sensitivities are driven by (i) an increase in biological oxygen consumption and decrease in vertical oxygen convergence in the upper-ocean, and (ii) a decrease in biological oxygen consumption in the deep ocean, with increasing remineralization. On the other hand, the ODZ area has a more complex, non-monotonic relationship with maximum remineralization rate. These findings may suggest that models with higher remineralization rates should expect ODZs that are shallower but of reduced volume and thickness, though the relative importance of remineralization vs. other physical parameterizations remains to be established.",2,309,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Due to biogeochemical interactions, these past ocean deoxygenations impacted the nutrient cycles and marine ecosystem, strongly influencing the ocean nitrogen system. Estimating OAEs triggers and potential consequences can help us understand the impact of global warming on ocean oxygen levels and their coupling with other biogeochemical and ecological processes. Here, we apply an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity (cGEnIE) to 1) reconstruct the state of ocean deoxygenation during OAEs, 2) quantify the triggers of global anoxia (comparing temperature versus nutrient effect), and 3) assess the OAEs impact on the ocean nitrogen cycle and its ecology.

Recently it was proposed that respiration slows in ocean ecosystems as they enter hypoxia because the Michaelis Menten constants (K<sub>m</sub>) of oxidative enzymes are several orders of magnitude higher than respiratory K<sub>m</sub> values (Giovannoni et al, 2021). A possible explanation for the slowing of respiration as ecosystems enter hypoxia is the inhibition of complete microbial oxidation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by the oxygen requirement of catabolic oxygenase enzymes. Both hypoxia and suboxia frequently occur on the Oregon Coast where they have substantial negative impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries. We conducted laboratory based mesocosm experiments using Oregon Coast seawater to measure the impacts of hypoxia on rates of DOM oxidation in hypoxic (~10 μM O<sub>2</sub>) and saturated (300 μM O<sub>2</sub>) conditions. Respiration rate, chlorophyll, metabolomics, total dissolved organic carbon, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, ammonia, and microbial community composition were measured for 15 weeks. Averaged over 100 days, microbial respiration rate observed in hypoxic conditions was 20% lower than in the saturated treatment.

Our Holocene fossil otolith time series from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea indicates extremely low overall abundances of mesopelagic fish during Sapropel S1 deposition, a time when bottom to mid-waters were highly anoxic, and surface waters were remarkably productive. Fish species adapted to the epipelagic habitat like the European anchovy (<em>Engraulis encrasicolus</em>) and the Silvery lightfish (<em>Maurolicus muelleri</em>), dominate the otolith record during S1 deposition. After reoxygenation, mesopelagic fish abundance increases, with lanternfish (myctophids) being the most dominant family from mid-Holocene to present times. Our results suggest a likely negative response of midwater fish fauna to the ongoing intensification and expansion of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) over coming centuries. A sharp decline of mesopelagic fish abundance would have major impacts on marine fisheries, marine conservation, ocean food web structure and carbon storage capacity, with adverse knock-on effects for global marine ecosystem services.",5,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza A,

Among the organisms that perform vertical migration and that we consider in this study are migrating zooplankton and mesopelagic fish. Vertical migration is often associated with different feeding strategies: migrating zooplanktion generally feed at the surface (in the epipelagic) during nighttime, but excrete and egest feces at depth during daytime. Mesopelagic fish feed both on mesopelagic as well as (to a smaller amount) epipelagic organisms and thus migrate vertically, but does not necessarily show such a distinct temporal migrating behaviour. The resulting vertical redistribution of organic matter that has been produced at the surface may also impact the nutrient cycle and will also likely have an impact on oxygen. Especially oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), that are located within the mesopelagial, might respond sensitive. To investigate these aspects, we integrated the mesopelagic ecosystem modelling approach introduced by Anderson et al. (2019) into the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic_ESCM). This new tool enables us to investigate not only the relevance of vertical migration and mesopelagic processes for vertical oxygen and nutrient distributions, but also but also the respective interactions with the global biogeochemistry. Following simulation of the new model to steady state, net primary production is reduced by 15-20% compared to simulations that exclude migration into the mesopelagial. The response of the global oxygen inventory to migratory processes is rather small. In contrast to that, we find that the migratory processes impact the size of the OMZs in the tropical Pacific by up to 17%, with a diverging response between the northern and southern Pacific OMZ. In addition the impact of the vertical distribution of mesopelagic fish on the extent of the OMZ is in our case larger compared to the impact of differences in the migration depth of the migrating zooplankton. Our results highlight the importance of a further detailed parameterisation of the behaviour of mesopelagic fish, especially with respect to its dynamic behaviour, loss terms and oxygen sensitivity.",3,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza A,

However, there has been much uncertainty on how environmental factors affect mixoplankton success across freshwater ecosystems. The <em>grand écart</em> hypothesis is a framework that considers light and nutrients availability as the key components of mixotrophs' niche. It suggests that some properties of ecosystems lead to the segregation of nutrients and light, and the need to access both creates the environmental filtering for mixotrophs. Here, we rationalized that ecosystem size is a property of lake ecosystems that can determine opposing gradients of light and nutrients, as well as other key environmental factors that determine mixoplankton success. We hypothesized that lake ecosystem size can mediate the prevalence of patterns and control mechanisms predicted by the <em>grand écart</em> hypothesis on mixoplankton relative biomass (MRB). Using data from 98 tropical lakes spanning 36.000 km<sup>2</sup>, we showed that lake size mediates the inverse relationship between light and nutrient availability. Bigger lakes have more light but low nutrients, and smaller lakes have more nutrients but shaded. Light availability predicts MRB in small lakes, and nutrients predict MRB in big lakes. MRB values were higher in small lakes, with secondary influence from zooplankton herbivory. Our results validate the <em>grand écart</em> hypothesis as a significant framework for predicting patterns and control mechanisms of mixoplankton. Highlights the significance of lake size as an ecosystem property that generates opposing light and nutrient gradients, further emphasizing its importance for understanding the regulation of freshwater aquatic ecosystems' biogeochemistry and functioning.",5,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Sala Portixol 2,

This technique has, however, been questioned a few times, as some studies report positive regression slopes, i.e., potential “negative grazing rates”. The reasons behind positive slopes are neither straightforward nor easy to discern, as these can be caused by several factors. Particularly, mixoplankton, single-celled organisms that combine phototrophy and phagotrophy, were not originally considered in the formulation of the theory behind the dilution technique. As a result, the technique is, currently, blind to photo-phago-mixotrophy, as mixoplankton behave simultaneously as predator and prey. Hence, there is a need to reappraise the technique to accommodate the mixoplankton paradigm. Our study explored the dynamics of the dilution experiment in a controlled environment, with known mixtures of phyto-, protozoo-, and mixo- plankton, operated under different light regimes and species combinations. Our results demonstrate the poor nature of chlorophyll as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, as well as the importance of considering diel feeding rhythms in the experimental design.

We hypothesize that phycoerythrin synthesis, which requires nuclear and plastidial genes, is altered in the hosts.

They are photosynthetic, but mixotrophic phagotrophy has also described. Recently, the small <em>P.</em> cf. <em>balticum</em> was shown to use a remarkable feeding strategy by crafting globular mucus traps to capture and immobilize potential prey. Here we present video observations and experimental data showing that two additional related species, the recently described <em>P. pervagatum</em> and the cosmopolitan bloom forming <em>P. cordatum</em>, also produce large (120 µm) mucus traps enabling their mixoplanktonic activity. Both species fed on <em>Teleaulax</em> cells entangled in these traps. Through openings in the mucus traps, <em>Prorcentrum</em> cells create water movement eddying particles from outside into the trap, or cells are more passively entangled upon contact with the trap´s outside. Trapped prey cells were immobile but remained alive. Uptake of prey trapped in the mucus was via a peduncle which always extruded from the apical area of the <em>Prorocentrum</em> cell. Phagotrophy of <em>P. pervagatum</em> supported faster growth compared to unfed controls, and time series quantification of food vacuoles revealed ingestion rates of about 12 <em>Teleaulax</em> prey cells per day. This study demonstrates that the large size and immobilization properties of mucus traps successfully increase the availability of prey for small <em>Prorocentrum</em> species, whose peduncle feeding mode impedes consumption of actively moving prey, and that this strategy is common among certain clades of small planktonic <em>Prorocentrum</em> species.",3,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Portixol 2,

Also, we tested the effects on their prey, which typically are cryptophytes belonging to the <em>Teleaulax/Plagioslemis/Geminigera</em> species complex. These cryptophytes not only serve as food for the ciliate, but also as a supplier of chloroplasts and prey nuclei. We exposed <em>M. rubrum</em> and the two cryptophyte species, <em>T. acuta, T. amphioxeia </em>to different pH (6.8 – 8) and DIC levels (~ 6.5 – 26 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>) and assessed their growth and photosynthetic rates, and cellular chlorophyll <em>a</em> and elemental contents.

The term ‘mixotroph’ has a long history and is defined in Henderson’s dictionary of biology as ‘<em>an organism using</em> <em>an inorganic compound as energy source and an organic compound as carbon source</em>’. However, while the common exemplar 'mixotroph’, the Venus flytrap, feeds for nutrients and not C, phytoplankton that consume dissolved free amino acids for C, energy and N via osmotrophy are often not viewed as mixotrophs even though by definition they are. In contrast, photo-phagotrophic protists are always referred to as mixotrophic, irrespective of why they feed. Ecologically, there is a critical distinction between protist plankton that are mixotrophic via osmotrophy versus via phagotrophy; the latter play a vital role in trophic dynamics through removal of prey/competitors. To provide a clear distinction between such organisms the term ‘mixoplankton’ was proposed, with a concise definition – ‘<em>protist plankton that are photo-phago-osmo-trophic</em>’. Mixoplankton are thus all mixotrophs, but not all planktonic mixotrophs are mixoplankton. Importantly for science, ‘mixoplankton’ also sets these protists apart from the photo-osmo-mixotrophic ‘phytoplankton’ and heterotrophic ‘zooplankton’. In moving away from a plant-animal dichotomy in marine ecology the term mixoplankton provides concise clarity.

(2012) method, adapted from Caffrey (2003, 2004). <em>In situ</em> direct measurements (incubation of bottles in light and darkness) were also combined at one of the sites, at surface and bottom levels during summer conditions. In the second area, the diel open-water technique with high frequency data acquisition (every 15 min) was also applied along 2.5 years (2017 to 2020), allowing capture of multiple timescales (from hourly to interannual). The data were spatial and temporal variables and the edges of Ria Formosa behaved predominantly as autotrophic (4 to 8 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) while the inner area behaved predominantly as “slightly” heterotrophic (<em>ca</em>. -1 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>).

Using a hydrodynamically calibrated sediment erosion device (EROMES), we quantified&nbsp;the impact of erosion events on benthic biogeochemistry across 4 seasons. Enhanced sediment erosion&nbsp;increased the benthic O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;uptake rate and the release of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This was mainly associated with the reoxidation of FeS<sub>x</sub> and enhanced&nbsp;mineralization of organic carbon, and for the latter due to a porewater washout of DIC.

Papakōlea Beach in Hawai’i is the world’s largest and best example of such a natural coastal analogue, comprising ∼90 wt % of olivine, a fast weathering Mg-silicate. It hence provides an opportunity to study the long-term rate and impact of olivine weathering, as envisioned in coastal ESW applications. In summer 2022, field investigations were conducted on Papakōlea beach (olivine sand) and the nearby Richardson Bay (carbonate sands). Sediment incubation were done to investigate the dissolution kinetics under natural conditions, the fate of weathering products from olivine dissolution, and to explore the influence of olivine dissolution on biogeochemical cycling and ecology. Our findings reveal alkalinity release from the incubated olivine sand of Papakōlea beach, as well as the calcium carbonate equivalent from Richardson Bay. The increase of alkalinity concentrations correlates with the production of dissolved inorganic carbon, indicating atmospheric CO<sub>2 </sub>uptake.

Mudflats, one of the various estuarine facies, are conducive to dense biofilm growth of microphytobenthos (MPB). These biofilms regulate carbon and oxygen exchange, sediment stabilization, and contribute up to 50% of estuarine primary productivity. MPB also serves as a critical food source for estuarine food webs. In temperate estuaries, biofacies experience up to two immersions and emersions every 24 hours due to macrotidal regimes. Most studies on MPB physiology focus on the emersion phase when productivity is highest. Our study aimed to assess the impact of immersion and emersion succession on MPB photosynthetic activity. To achieve this, a laboratory experiment simulated the succession of immersion and emersion inside a climate chamber. Oxygen profiles and fluorescence measurements were taken during each emersion to assess MPB response. Laboratory emersion periods were based on in situ observations, and the experiment used an autonomous Photosynthesis-Irradiance (P-I) curve acquisition system to ensure standardized conditions. The experiment studied a sediment core over several days, acquiring around 3000 vertical oxygen profiles with the P-I curve acquisition system. We observed variations in incident light at the water-sediment interface during emersions at different times of day and described the mechanisms involved during the succession of emersion and immersion in relation to MPB light history.",5,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Portixol 2,

To date, little is known about how these communities change in composition and substrate utilisation across seasons. Here, we sampled surface sediments from Isfjorden, Svalbard, in winter, spring, and summer 2021 to 2022. We fractionated the sediment into the pore water (PW), cells which are loosely attached to grains (LA), and those firmly attached to grains (FA). We then assessed seasonal shifts in the community composition of the fractions through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and quantified hydrolysis rates of fluorescently-labelled laminarin and mucin, a common polysaccharide and glycoprotein in the marine environment. Across seasons, cell numbers in the bulk sediment were 2-4x10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL; up to 90% were in the FA fraction. Cell counts in PW and LA fluctuated more, with an increase in spring for PW (4% +/- 2%) and in spring and summer for LA (9% +/- 3%) In PW and LA, there were more <em>Colwellia</em>, <em>Polaribacter</em>, <em>Yoonia-Loktanella</em> in spring and summer, while there were more <em>Lutimonas</em> in winter.

There is a general scarcity of studies targeting nutrient fluxes and benthic metabolism measurements in different contrasting human impacted area, in particular in low latitude coastal zones. In this study, the impact on nutrient fluxes and benthic metabolism was observed in an oyster farming at Cananéia-Iguape Estuarine-Lagoon Complex (pristine estuary) and in a sewage discharge area in São Vicente-Santos Estuarine Complex (impacted estuary), in southeastern Brazilian coast. Intact sediment corers were sampled on both estuaries in two seasons (summer and winter) and processed in laboratory. Laboratorial dark incubations were performed to measured flux of dissolved gases and inorganic nutrients. A second incubation was performed with stable isotope paring techniques, to observe the effects on the benthic denitrification rates. Results showed a higher metabolism in sediment of São Vicente in both seasons. These results coincide with a bigger macrofauna and higher organic matter and chlorophyll content in this location. In general, São Vicente station showed the highest values of organic matter, higher regeneration from sediments of ammonium and nitrate and dinitrogen consumption, and higher rates of denitrification.

However, our understanding of these processes is limited by the need to collect intact sediment cores and extract the porewater for chemical analysis in order to measure the concentrations and gradients of the compounds involved, precluding observations in dynamic areas. Here we demonstrate a new approach for performing <em>in situ</em> time series measurements of nitrate concentrations in sediment pore water. An autonomous lab-on-chip sensor which performs spectrophotometric nitrate measurements was deployed in an estuarine river on the UK’s south coast. Rhizon filters were attached to the sensor’s sample intakes and inserted horizontally into the sediment to extract pore water for analysis, with one measuring the nitrate in the overlying water. Repeat measurements at 2.5-3 cm depth (n=124 over 5 days in winter; n=124 over 3 days in summer) revealed tidal and seasonal influences on pore water nitrate concentration. In winter, the pore water nitrate ranged from 0-30 &amp;micro;M with a tidal cycle out of phase with that of the water above. In summer the pore water nitrate ranged 0-8 &amp;micro;M with a tidal cycle in phase with the overlying water. This powerful technique can reveal temporal variability in porewater biogeochemistry, which is hard to capture by traditional methods.

Cable bacteria can increase the availability of both reactants in sediment porewater by mediating nitrate reduction to nitrite and by promoting the dissolution of FeS minerals. We thereby hypothesized that chemodenitrification is stimulated in sediment with cable bacteria. Sediment cores from Aarhus harbour (Denmark) were incubated under aerated, nitrate-amended water. Additional sediment cores were provided with filters at 0.3 cm depth to minimize cable bacteria growth. Electric fields diagnostic of cable bacteria activity developed to intensities up to three fold higher in the treatment cores compared to the filter controls over a two-week period. Nitrous oxide was sporadically detected in the filter-controls (max conc. 5 µM), whereas it was consistently present in the treatment cores reaching concentrations up to 20 µM in the sediment subsurface. Nitrous oxide production occurred below the oxygen penetration depth excluding possible contribution from nitrification. Notably, nitrous oxide production rates and electric field intensities were positively correlated both in treatment (Pearson, r=0.96, p=0.001) and filter-control cores (Pearson, r=0.80, p=0.057).

Oxygen appears as the prime electron acceptor in lacustrine methane oxidation (MOx). Methane oxidizing microorganisms seem to thrive even under micro-oxic conditions, i.e., they may be responsible for significant methane turnover at extremely low, or “cryptic”, oxygen concentrations, for example in stratified lakes. Under anoxic condition, they may also use electron acceptors other than oxygen, yet our understanding of the modes and microbial players of true anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) in freshwater environments is still incomplete. Here we showcase different scenarios in meromictic lakes where the combined lacustrine “aerobic/anaerobic methane filter” works efficiently. We demonstrate that strong MOx potentials can be maintained across redox transition zones, below which bacterial AOM is additionally fueled by nitrite/nitrate or other oxidants. We also show that sulfate-dependent archaeal AOM in lake sediments can be stimulated in the presence of Fe and Mn oxides through oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds.

In the literature, fish bioturbation has resulted in both reduced and enhanced emissions GHG emissions from sediments. To explore how the frequency of disturbance impacts the levels of methane emissions and the associated microbial communities, we quantified GHG emissions in sediment microcosms treated with various frequencies of mechanical disturbance, analogous to different levels of activity in benthic feeding fish. GHG emissions were largely driven by methane ebullition and were highest for the intermediate disturbance frequency (7 days). The lowest emissions were for the highest frequency treatment (3 days). While total microbial community structure did not differ among treatments, among methanogenic Archaea, we observed a shift towards greater relative abundance of a putatively oxygen-tolerant methanogenic phylotype (<em>ca.</em> Methanothrix paradoxum) in the highest frequency treatments and at depths impacted by disturbance (1 cm). <em>ca.</em> Methanothrix paradoxum demonstrated no change in abundance, suggesting disturbance negatively and preferentially impacted other methanogen populations. However, total methane emissions were not simply a function of methanogen populations and were likely impacted by the residence time of methane. Low frequency mechanical disruption resulted in lower methane ebullition compared to higher frequency treatments, which in turn resulted in reduced overall methane release, likely through enhanced methanotrophic activities. Overall, this work contributes to understanding how animal behavior may impact variation in GHG emissions and provides insight into how frequency of disturbance may impact emissions.&nbsp;",2,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

However, there is limited data about winter N cycling rates and the microbes involved on, and about the role of organic matter quality on N cycling. We studied 2 oligotrophic large boreal lakes in North Karelia, Finland, with clear-water and brown-water sides, and an additional side affected by mining resulting in higher nitrate and sulphate levels in the hypolimnion.

Questions remain, in particular, regarding the relative importance of nitrification versus denitrification as key N<sub>2</sub>O production processes, and their regulation by different environmental factors. To identify key metabolic pathways of N<sub>2</sub>O production in the BUS, and to assess the microbial players involved, we combined N<sub>2</sub>O production rate measurements, and analysis of natural abundance isotope composition of N<sub>2</sub>O with microbial diversity analysis of nitrifying and denitrifying microbial communities.

Until recently, methane production was thought to be a strictly anaerobic process confined primarily to anoxic sediments. However, supersaturation of methane in oxygenated waters has been consistently observed in lakes and the ocean (termed the ‘methane paradox’), indicating that methane can be produced under oxic conditions through unclear mechanisms. Here we show aerobic methane production from multiple sources in freshwater incubation experiments under different treatments and based on biogeochemical, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic data. We find that aerobic methane production appears to be associated with (bacterio)chlorophyll metabolism and photosynthesis, as well as with Proteobacterial degradation of methylphosphonate. Genes encoding pathways for putative photosynthetic- and methylphosphonate-based methane production also co-occur in Proteobacterial metagenome-assembled genomes.

However, drivers and production pathways of this methane are yet unknown. Permeable sediments are remarkable for frequent changes between oxic and anoxic conditions and high sulfate concentrations, characteristics which are typically thought to inhibit growth and activity of obligately anaerobic archaeal methanogens. Recent research into marine methane emissions have focussed on non-archaeal methane production. However, evidence presented here indicates that archaeal methanogens may be able to survive and thrive in these dynamic surface sediments, using unconventional methanogenic substrates. We present the results of a range of ex situ experiments on surface sands from South-Eastern Australia, including selective inhibition of archaeal methanogenesis, specific substrate additions and methane production rate measurements. These are supported by metagenomic analysis and field studies. Results show that archaeal methanogens were the primary source of methane production in surface sediments and production was largely driven by methylotrophic methanogenesis within timescales of hours-days. It is proposed that marine algae (macro- and micro-) and seagrasses are a significant source of methylated substrates in coastal waters and may cause large methane emissions from sandy coasts where they (or their debris) are present.

Combining the stable isotopic composition of methane (δ<sup>13</sup>C-CH<sub>4</sub>) in porewater and surface water can reveal the fraction of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidized or emitted to the atmosphere. Here, we report high-temporal resolution CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations from creek waters and porewater at two mangrove creeks in Brazil along with measurements of δ<sup>13</sup>C of CH<sub>4</sub>. Enriched δ<sup>13</sup>C-CH<sub>4</sub> in top surface layer sediments indicates CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in the surface sediment before porewaters reach the water column.

Experimental and within-site studies have shown strong temperature dependence of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, yet global-scale syntheses have emphasized the need to consider the effect of temperature in the context of landscape drivers such as slope, soil carbon storage and local hydrology. In this study, we leveraged a new fluvial CH<sub>4</sub> database (GRIMeDB) to evaluate the relative strength of temperature and stream discharge in predicting CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations from 172 sites with more than 20 observations of gas concentration coupled to one or both of the predictor variables (n<sub>obs</sub> = 4887), using hierarchical linear models.

We sampled the community of MOB and nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs in a stratified, freshwater lake across a range of dissolved oxygen and methane concentrations as well as temperature, modeling how the community composition and these factors interact over a year. We measured MOx rate in short-term<em> </em><em>in situ</em> incubations. MOB and nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs respond differently to oxygen and methane concentrations, with MOB positively correlating with hypoxia and low methane concentrations and nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs correlating with temperature. The MOx rate constant correlates best with the relative abundance of <em>Methylococcaceae</em>—obligate MOB—suggesting they are the primary drivers for MOx in this system and have little variation in their per-cell MOx.

The diurnal variability in GHG fluxes is known to be strongly influenced by various physical and biogeochemical factors, including water temperature, wind speed, primary production, and photochemical reactions. However, our understanding of how diurnal variability in gas emission processes changes over seasons is very limited. In this study, we conducted a year-long analysis of daily changes in GHG emissions from a eutrophic reservoir in Southern Spain. Our findings revealed similar daily patterns for CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes, with higher emissions during the day than during the night, particularly during the summer months. Additionally, the stratification period led to nighttime peaks in CH4 and N2O fluxes. Furthermore, our study also identified significant dependences between GHG emissions and various environmental factors, such as radiation, wind speed, and water temperature. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying GHG emissions from reservoirs, and the challenges in accurately estimating these emissions at a global scale. In addition, our study emphasizes the significance of incorporating various time scales to evaluate the variability in future GHG measurements and models and provides important insights for developing effective mitigation strategies for these emissions.",0,,6/5/23 10:30,6/5/23 12:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

Using a unique, long-term dataset of vertical profiles and high-frequency data collected intermittently over the past 20 years from 15 oligotrophic lakes located near Kangerlussuaq in West Greenland, we investigate how changing ice-out and weather conditions affect lake thermal structure and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. Ice-out timing and weather conditions immediately following ice-out have a decisive impact on temperatures in hypolimnion, with the highest hypolimnetic temperatures (~13ºC) occurring during years when early ice-out is coupled with cooler air temperatures, and the lowest (~4ºC) in years when late ice-out and higher air temperatures prevent full spring mixing in some lakes. We also found that warmer hypolimnion is associated with less hypoxia. This unexpected correlation is a result of higher potential for a substantive spring mixing in years with early ice-out. By affecting the variability of spring mixing occurrence and duration, shifts in ice phenology can have unexpected consequences for lakes at high latitudes that differ from expectations based on temperate regions.&nbsp;",2,,6/7/23 10:30,6/7/23 12:00,Sala Menorca B,

Inputs of DOM have increased in northern boreal lakes, reflecting combined effects of climate warming, reduced acidification and land use change. Higher CDOM content in lakes intensifies the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), leading to an overall increasing attenuation of PAR with depth&nbsp;and hence lower underwater light availability for photosynthetic organisms. Increasing CDOM content is&nbsp;known to affect light availability for&nbsp;phytoplankton, but quantitative analyses of the responses of light absorption by freshwater phytoplankton are scarce. We compiled spectral absorption properties and water quality measures from 128 lakes representing the variation in water colour, DOC and nutrients in boreal lakes, and studied light availability and absorption by phytoplankton in the lakes. Here we present results of i) how much of the PAR arriving to lakes is captured by phytoplankton, ii) the major determinants of the relative absorption by phytoplankton based on common water quality measures, and iii) the response of light absorption by phytoplankton to increasing CDOM content using a dataset of 2250 boreal lakes.

Riverine chemistry also regulates ecosystem function across Earth’s land-ocean continuum, exerting control from the micro- (e.g., food web) to the macro- (e.g., carbon cycle) scale. In the rapidly warming Arctic, a wide range of processes have been hypothesized to alter river water chemistry. However, it is unknown how the land-ocean flux of waterborne constituents is changing at the pan-Arctic scale. Here, we show profound shifts in the concentration and transport of biogeochemical constituents in the six largest Arctic rivers (the Ob’, Yenisey, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie) since 2003, near river mouths capturing two-thirds of the pan-Arctic watershed. While some constituent fluxes increase substantially at the pan-Arctic scale (alkalinity and associated ions), others decline (nitrate and associated inorganic nutrients) or are overall unchanged (dissolved organics). These clear but divergent trends diagnose a multi-systems perturbation that indicates alteration of processes ranging from chemical weathering on land, to primary production in the coastal ocean. We anticipate these findings will refine models of current and future functioning of the coupled land-ocean Arctic system, and spur research on scale-dependent change across the river-integrated Arctic domain.",0,330,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, limited information exists regarding the effects of WR on other ecosystem services such as aquatic carbon export. An emerging issue from a water quality perspective is the brownification of many surface waters caused by increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Also, stream networks are strong emitters of greenhouse gases (GHG), and where wetlands are a main source for downstream emissions. Literature on WR effects on surface water DOC and GHG is scarce and with divergent results. Hence, science-based knowledge is urgently needed to make well-founded decisions about WR efforts, including an aquatic C perspective. In this study, WR effects on aquatic C have been explored across the forested landscape of Sweden by sampling 33 restored and 33 non-restored wetlands that have historically been drained. The wetlands were selected to cover a large latitudinal gradient as well as differences in nutrient status. Wetland outlets were sampled in spring and autumn 2022 for a full set of water chemistry variables, and with particular focus on DOC and GHG. Independent on season, DOC and GHG concentrations were significantly higher in the outlets of restored than non-restored wetlands, and the difference was especially pronounced in northern Sweden.

Such restoration efforts are already being widely conducted across Sweden and the plan is to continue at large scales. However, limited information exists regarding the effects of restoration on lateral export of carbon (C) via the aquatic pathway. Any changes in the lateral C flux are critical to consider as it affects the overall wetland carbon balance and may offset any climatic benefits from the restoration. In addition to the carbon balance perspective, changes in the aquatic C export could affect downstream surface water quality. In this study, we monitored aquatic C (DOC, DIC and CH<sub>4</sub>) in two streams draining a boreal wetland that was rewetted during autumn 2020. By comparing pre- (2018-2020) and post- (2020-2022) restoration periods we were able to detect any changes in the aquatic C pool. The results showed that the restoration effect was site-, season- and carbon component-specific. One of the stream sites showed no effect of the restoration on aquatic C, whereas the other site showed overall elevated (DOC) or highly elevated (CH<sub>4</sub>) concentrations post restoration. For DOC, the increase mainly occurred during autumn and winter, whereas increased CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were visible at all seasons.

Concurrently, organic material previously sequestered in permafrost becomes accessible to microbial degradation. We aim to identify the drivers of dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation in these small aquatic systems in order to better understand carbon cycling in Arctic lowlands. During summers 2017 to 2019, ponds displaying different levels of permafrost erosion and colonization by primary producers were sampled in a glacier valley on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada). We assessed spatial variations in DOM concentration, absorbance and fluorescence (PARAFAC modelling), and in the speciation of nutrients. Filtered water from 15 ponds was incubated over 180 days in the dark and we quantified the loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over time, with a subset of samples enriched with nutrients. Different aspects of bacterial metabolism were also measured along with environmental conditions. The results show that despite differences in DOM and nutrient availability, DOC decline was similar among ponds; about 30% of DOC was consumed. However, nutrient addition doubled the rate of DOC decomposition in ponds characterized by high permafrost erosion. Hypoxic bottom water layers were also identified as hot spots for the microbial transformation of DOM. A better understanding of DOM processing in these abundant water bodies is key to assess future trends in lateral carbon export along the terrestrial-aquatic continuum in the Arctic, and its impact on futur climate.",1,,6/7/23 10:30,6/7/23 12:00,Sala Menorca B,

To identify differences in greenhouse gas (GHG) production across these ecoregions, limnological data collected in situ were complimented by anoxic incubation experiments, measuring CO<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4</sub> production rates. Lakes with deciduous forest catchments (transition from boreal forest to Prairies) had the highest GHG production rates, possibly caused by a combination of more labile terrestrial organic matter inputs and warmer temperatures (than the lakes within coniferous forests and tundra), and a tendency to stratification (relative to more open grassland lakes). Overall, the southern lakes had higher productivity and higher CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations, while surface N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations were higher in northern lakes. Surprisingly, northern boreal lakes were also prone to eutrophication – likely as a consequence of forest fires, increasingly common in these areas.

Continuous estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across this drainage network reveal a diversity of seasonal patterns, which reflect the joint influences of physical constraints and nutrient limitation on rates of stream biological activity. At diel time scales, GPP can in turn create significant biogeochemical signals that are meaningful to broader-scale flux estimates. At seasonal scales, variation in the development of metabolic capacity in streams further governs the extent to which biological processes can influence carbon and nitrogen fluxes downstream.

There were spatial patterns in the composition (e.g. C:N, %OM, OM fluorescence properties) and accumulation rates of C and Hg across lakes, which relate to geographic context (e.g. depth, size, watershed characteristic, flow alteration). These results suggest natural and anthropogenic levels of variation both in terms of the concentration and composition of OM and Hg in sediments, which need to be taken into account to understand past accumulation of C and Hg in boreal lakes.",2,323,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

As a result, sediment temperatures are increasing, leading to faster decomposition rates and potentially higher greenhouse gas emissions. Because shallow ponds and lakes&nbsp;warm up faster than larger waterbodies, the effects of warming&nbsp;may be stronger. However, field measurements for shallow Arctic lakes and ponds are scarce, especially for methane ebullition (the emission of methane through bubbles). Here we present data on diffusion and ebullition fluxes of methane, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from more than 50 different lakes and ponds near Churchill, Manitoba. Lakes and ponds in this area are shallow with measurements ranging from 10 to 230 cm. The ebullition methane flux was roughly an order of magnitude higher than the diffusion flux. The&nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O diffusion varied from uptake to release, the latter of which was generally low. While ebullition bubbles also contained&nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, their concentration&nbsp;was roughly 10 to 100 times as low as methane.&nbsp;When methane is released through ebullition it largely circumvents methane oxidation by methanotrophs. Since ebullition is expected to increase globally, this might increase the proportion of methane produced in sediments that is directly transferred to the atmosphere. This underlies the importance of ebullition as a methane emission pathway in shallow Arctic lakes and ponds.&nbsp;",4,324,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

All these changes are impacting soil organic matter cycling as well as hydrologic export from soils to adjacent streams and lakes as particulate and dissolved organic matter (DOM). As export and sources change, DOM is also expected to change, both in its chemical diversity and reactivity. DOM chemical diversity defines its availability for the microbial community and thus, ultimately the C export to the Arctic Ocean. Here, we evaluate how changes in landscape controls such as in hydrological connectivity and rock-weathering may impact DOM composition, stability and degradation. Our results include the evaluation of indices describing DOM chemical diversity as predictors of DOM degradation, the link between the distribution of such diversity across water bodies (including both streams and lakes/ponds) and its relation with landscape setting.

The importance and the characteristics of nutrient recycling by aquatic animals may vary relative to the trophic position (primary to tertiary consumer) and abiotic factors such as ambient nutrient conditions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). DOC-induced changes in light penetration and nutrient supply can affect resource availability to aquatic primary producers and potentially the release of nutrients from aquatic animals. In this study, we examined the effect of DOC on the nitrogen and phosphorus release of four fish species and their contribution to ecosystem recycling in eleven lakes that varied in ambient DOC and DOM composition at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. While we did not find a relationship between fish soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) excretion rates and DOC, fish-mediated N contribution was highest in the high DOC lakes. Overall, invertivores/piscivores excreted SRP and NH<sub>4</sub>-N at the highest rates, followed by invertivores and omnivores.

The fate of this carbon is under debate because&nbsp;GHG&nbsp;emissions from thawing permafrost could create a retroaction loop amplifying warming. At the same time terrestrial vegetation is gaining in biomass as climate warms, also occurring within shallow ponds infilling with vegetation at an accelerated pace. Our study investigates the degradability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) originating from deep permafrost, active layer and local primary producers (PP), as compared with DOM collected from surrounding&nbsp;ponds. Laboratory incubations using artificial radiation were carried out to compare degradation effects by light and bacteria. PP leachates were&nbsp;dominated by protein-like compounds, and their&nbsp;biomineralization (as DOC loss) was the largest (permafrost leachates in second place). Active layer and pond DOM, both dominated by humic-like terrestrial compounds, were&nbsp;the most photomineralized pools.

Ten-hour grazing experiments at three temperatures (16℃, 23℃, 30℃) were conducted with adult mysids.

As global change is altering variability, understanding how key food web structures maintain stability in the face of variation becomes critical. Surprisingly, little research has been undertaken to mechanistically understand how key food web structures are expected to operate in a noisy world and what this means for stability. Omnivory, for example, has been historically well studied but largely from a static perspective. Recent empirical evidence suggests that the strength of omnivory varies in response to changing conditions in ways that may be fundamental to stability. Here, we extend existing omnivory theory to predict how omnivory responds to variation and to show that dynamic omnivory responses are indeed a potent stabilizing structure in the face of variation.

They serve as prey for a variety of predators; however, less is known about mysids' feeding ecology though their diets often include a wide variety of prey resources. Because many species of mysid engage in diel vertical or horizontal migration and are generalist consumers, they are likely to play an important role in coupling trophic pathways (e.g., benthic, pelagic) in coastal ecosystems. The larger goal of this project is to build and validate a multi-species functional response (MSFR) modeling framework to quantify mysid consumption of different prey types under environmentally realistic conditions. A critical first step toward building MSFR models involves performing predator-prey functional response experiments to determine predator grazing rates across a range of concentrations of different prey types.

Modeled individual growth and pelagic resource contribution to growth were positively related to migration participation, as expected.

One of the key knowledge gaps in our understanding of the mesopelagic is the structure of its food webs, especially how they support unquantified foraging activity by commercially valuable, highly migratory top predators such as tuna and swordfish. We address this knowledge gap by leveraging a unique sampling event of a pelagic longline vessel alongside with two oceanographic vessels providing simultaneous context in the North Atlantic, August 2022. The flow of carbon through the pelagic food web is described from particulate organic matter, through mid-level consumers, up to top predators via compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids. Predator foraging activity in mesopelagic vs surface waters is further examined via conventional gut content analysis of the same individuals.

Recovery time and peak disturbance magnitude differed among non-experimental lakes. Lakes with phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a time series rarely had concurrent disturbances in both variables. Algal bloom disturbances and recoveries can be accurately detected with appropriate reference data, but the problem is more difficult in non-experimental lakes due to the complexities of reference data selection, missing values, and pigment sensor errors. Overall the approach shows promise in quantifying algal bloom dynamics where long-term high frequency data are available.",4,337,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

As reliance on these technologies increases, in part due to their large sample size, easy implementation, and cost efficiency, a need arises for cross-validation of the resulting datasets with the contents of physical trawl samples. During a recent research expedition to the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, two experimental remote sensing technologies (UAV and timelapse camera strip transects) were deployed simultaneously with sampling trawls and visual surveys to gather a holistic and comprehensive dataset on the quantity and composition of plastic debris afloat at the sea surface. Manta (0.9m opening, 0.5mm mesh size) and Mega (6m opening, 1.5cm mesh size) surface trawl nets were deployed alongside tethered UAVs, vessel-mounted timelapse cameras, and visual surveyors in various areas of the plastic accumulation zone in the North Pacific. Physical validation of the footage collected by the UAVs’ strip scans and timelapse cameras has allowed for a side-by-side comparison of the various remote sensing methods with traditional physical trawling. A compositional analysis of the net trawls was conducted to investigate the selectivity and potential biases of the visual and camera-based observations. By comparing how and whether different debris items were registered by multiple sampling techniques, we can assess the strengths and limitations related to the use of remote sensing for detection of plastic debris afloat at sea.",2,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Sala Menorca B,

Targeting fisheries sustainability, one of the main expected effects of MPAs is spillover effect. That is, the exportation of commercial species biomass outside the protected areas as a consequence of its increased abundance inside the fishing bans boundaries.The European regulation of Western Mediterranean Multiannual Plan for demersal stock management (2019) stated MPAs should be established for fisheries sustainability. In the Spanish Mediterranean coast, trawling fisheries were banned in a total of 41 new marine protected areas (MPAs), 21 of which are permanent (973 km<sup>2</sup>) and 16 temporary (6013 km<sup>2</sup>). After the establishment of MPAs, it remains crucial to correctly reinforce and monitor them to allow an adaptative fisheries management approach based on sound scientific advice. In this work, we present a methodology that combines trawling Vessel Monitoring System data and commercial fishing landings datasets to evaluate spillover effects after the protection of an MPA. After testing the methodology in three MPAs closed for 10 and 5 years there were evidences of spillover effects for some of the most important commercial species. These results validate the methodology used and will allow to expand the data analysis to all the Spanish Mediterranean trawling fleets and closed areas. It is an example of how digital technologies allow marine non-invasive monitoring to work towards the sustainability of marine resources. &nbsp;",5,339,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

At McGill University, we developed a digital in-line holographic microscopy (nano-DIHM) technique for aquatic matrices for&nbsp;<em>in situ&nbsp;</em>real-time analysis of particle size, shape, intensity and phase. Nano-DIHM enables 4-D tracking of particles in water and their transformations in three-dimensional space. We demonstrate that nano-DIHM can be automated to detect and track oil spills/oil droplets in dynamic systems (Pal et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2022). We present how nano-DIHM can detect microplastics, biological entities such as MS2 bacteriophage as a representative biological-viral material and mercury-containing particles alongside other heavy metals as common toxic contaminants. Nano-DIHM shows the capability of observation of combined materials in water, characterizing the interactions of various particles in mixtures and particles with different coatings in a suspension. The observed sizes of the particles and droplets ranged from ∼1 to 200&nbsp;<em>μ</em>m. We herein discuss the ability of nano-DIHM to characterize and distinguish particle-based contaminants in water and their interactions in both stationary and dynamic modes with a 62.5 millisecond time resolution. The fully automated software for dynamic and real-time detection of contaminants will be of global significance. A comparison is also made between nano-DIHM and established techniques such as S/TEM for their different capabilities. Nano-DIHM can provide a range of physicochemical information in stationary and dynamic modes, allowing life cycle analysis of various particle contaminants in different aquatic systems and serving as an effective tool for rapid response to spills and remediation of natural waters. Since this equipment can be remotely sensed, it will provide a rapid response system for better management of the environmental and health challenges now and in future. &nbsp; References: ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devendra Pal, Yevgen Nazarenko, Thomas C.

To address this, we quantified the size distribution of produced NP and SMP particles on the surface of virgin- and additive-containing (PP) sheet. We achieved this by exposing them to photooxidation with water in a simulated sunlight chamber, followed by mechanical abrasion. The fragmentation rate of PP and PPa (additive-containing PP) was similar following 176 days of simulated sunlight exposure with subsequent mechanical abrasion (corresponding to 2.7 years of exposure in an outdoor environment in the Republic of Korea). However, considering the quadratic regression graphs for PP, which display the relationship between total particles produced and exposure duration, it is possible that the fragmentation rate of PP could be faster than PPa after a certain point of sunlight exposure duration (i.e., after 2.7 years). We also observed that mechanical stress from vortexing played a significant role in the production of MPs, but a smaller role in the production of NPs. Fragmented particle sizes produced through photooxidation and mechanical stress followed a power law distribution, with a scaling exponent of α = 2.87 ± 0.15, which was similar to a three-dimensional fragmentation pattern. Future studies with longer experimental periods are needed to precisely quantify the differences in fragmentation rates of PP and PPa under different environmental conditions.",4,347,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Most studies build on particle numbers, so little mass-based information is available. Reservoirs and dams are understudied, but important for water management. We conducted a one-time survey of surface water and sediments from six water bodies in 2018. Samples were sieved, and sediment fractions were density-separated using sodium polytungstate. Plastics were analyzed by detecting specific polymers by TED-GC/MS, considering polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, styrene-butadiene rubber, acrylates and polyamide 6. We focused on the 100-500 micrometer size fraction and the top 5 cm of sediments. In water samples, polystyrene was most frequently detected, followed by polypropylene. Main reservoirs with a pre-dam had the lowest concentrations, and only one site exceeded &gt;1 mg per cubic meter. This suggests that pre-dams may efficiently retain inflow-borne microplastics. In sediments, polyethylene was detected throughout and dominated microplastic mass. Polystyrene and polypropylene were next frequently detected. Microplastic concentrations in the analyzed size fraction exceeded 1 g/kg in some cases. However, the varying contribution of that fraction to the total sediment must be considered. Sediments were very fine-grained except one dammed river. Including additional fractions may decrease or increase total concentrations.

Research efforts have improved our understanding of MP flux via riverine networks, but knowledge regarding key hot moments is still limited. Closing this knowledge gap is vital in urban catchments, where diffuse sources dominate and failure to understand MP mobilisation events can result in severe underestimations of MP flux. This study provides a high-resolution snapshot of how river water MP concentrations, loads and characteristics changed over the course of a single precipitation event. The Bournbrook, a headwater stream within the Trent basin, UK, was sampled during a light precipitation event (&lt;2 mm/h) after a 10-day dry period. More than 30 samples were taken, extensively covering the storm hydrograph and baseflow conditions. River water was filtered over a 64 µm sieve. MP counts and characteristics were determined via fluorescence microscopy after organic matter digestion. Baseflow concentrations and loading exhibited low variability (range= 0.01 to 0.15 MP/L, load = 10.4 MP/s). During the event concentrations spiked immediately following an overland flow input (0.99 MP/L) before falling to 0.69 MP/L. Before peak discharge concentration and load peaked at 1.69 MP/L and 759 MP/s. This study shows that even a small rain event can result in the mass mobilisation of MP within an urban catchment and that sampling frequency can dramatically alter our perspective of how MP concentrations respond to discrete changes in a storm hydrograph.",1,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,

Several studies demonstrated that MP surface in various marine ecosystems were enriched with pathogenic bacteria, while other suggested that plastisphere might be a hotspot for horizontal gene transfer.

At the same time, the biodegradability of TWP was evaluated by testing in a closed respirometer. The results showed that the average size of TWP was about 50 µm and contained a high concentration of zinc (8873 µg/g). During aging, a biofilm formed rapidly on the surface of TWP, resulting in a decrease in density - the initial density was 1.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and decreased to 1.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Leaching of zinc was greatest during the first two weeks, after which the concentration gradually decreased. TOC analysis showed that TOC leached at the beginning of aging and then in the last four weeks, which is consistent with the measurement of the amount of biofilm, which decreased in the last four weeks, indicating the possible decomposition of the biofilm on TWP.

In addition, information on the vertical distribution of MPs is needed to elucidate the MP fate within lakes and the lake’s role in the transport of MPs from land to the ocean (the ‘plastic pathway’). We examined seasonal samples to assess the vertical distribution of MPs in Lake Lugano (CH-IT), a lake that was shown to be highly contaminated by MPs. We divided the lake into five vertical layers (surface, epilimnion, metalimnion, hypolimnion, sediments) and evaluate MP concentration and signature (size, shape) within each layer. MPs occurred across these layers, showing highest concentrations in epi- and metalimnion (60.0±12.9 MP m<sup>-3</sup>, 0-20 m depth), and lowest concentrations in the hypolimnion (4.3±0.1 MP m<sup>-3</sup>). The application of a mass-balance model indicated that most of the MPs entering the lake settle within the lake.

The TRACE project.,"It is assumed that the main source of plastic litter to the oceans is terrestrial from rivers and waterways. Therefore, the dominant plastic pathways from land sources to the ocean is via coastal regions. However, it is not clear how the plastic particles are transported by coastal waves and currents once they are discharged to the marine environment. Within the new TRACE project, a practical tool is being developed to understand floating marine litter (FML) pathways in coastal regions and to map hotspots, concentration values and their fluctuations. This tool combines a coastal FML numerical model and FML monitoring in coastal regions using a citizen science approach. The tool is applied to the coastal zone of Barcelona, a densely populated industrial and commercial zone. The numerical model uses hydrodynamic information from three different nested grids to obtain the FML transport with enough resolution at the coastal scale but also allowing a proper FML tracking over a regional scale and FML motion from river mouths to coastal regions and the continental shelf. The monitoring approach includes FML collection in city beaches, rivers mouths and drain discharge regions. Preliminary results from both monitoring and modelling shows large FML accumulation in the Barcelona coastline suggesting large storage rates of the FML in the coastal zone with large rates of FML from rivers returning to the dry beach and low export rates to the open ocean.

Here we directly examine the microbiomes of oceanic rafting seaweed, leveraging host genomic analyses, amplicon sequencing, and oceanographic modelling to study the impacts of stochastic ecological dispersal of hosts on the microbiome. We find that during their voyage, rafts tend to shift from a community dominated by core microbes to a community dominated by a few abundant taxa, and many rare taxa. Raft microbiomes rapidly diverge from those of non-rafts, with changes in selective pressures leading to major community changes and increased dysbiosis over the course of oceanic rafting. These data have particular significance under scenarios of increasing environmental variability such as those arising from climate change, where host range shifts are likely to lead to increased movement of hosts along broader ecological ranges.",3,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

However, through defecation, animals transfer a portion of their gut microbiome to the environment together with organic matter, nutrients, and metabolic byproducts. These inputs can directly shape the external environment in a way that may support the persistence of gut microbiota outside the host gut. This coupled gut-environment meta-ecosystem – which we term the meta-gut – may allow ex situ gut microbes to persist in the environment and, at sufficiently high densities, influence ecosystem processes. We surveyed hippopotamus pools spanning a gradient of hippo loading in the Mara River, Kenya, for their biogeochemistry, ecosystem function and microbial community composition. We found that hippos alter the biogeochemistry of pools variably depending on hippo number and water residence time, with large inputs of hippo feces under low flow conditions causing pools to switch from an oxic to an anoxic state. These anoxic conditions facilitate the external persistence of hippo gut microbes. 16S rRNA sequencing of the total RNA has shown that the microbial community in the river begins to functionally resemble that of the hippo gut. The presence and activity of hippo gut microbes in the bottom waters of hippo pools could accelerate the decomposition of organic matter, despite the anoxic conditions, and potentially contribute to the higher rates of ecosystem respiration and concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane we have measured in the pools.

We investigated the spatial distribution of bulk dark DIC fixation in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean and the cell-specific bicarbonate uptake rates determined by microautoradiography. Higher bulk DIC fixation and relative abundance of prokaryotes taking up DIC were found in epipelagic waters (~30% of total prokaryotes) than in mesopelagic waters.

Multiple analytical methods were used to characterize the environmental conditions and prokaryotic community structures, and further analyses were used to determine which environmental metadata might best explain the prokaryotic community compositions identified at each station within the transects. We conclude that the prokaryotic community structures from the samples collected in autumn were most influenced by latitude and dissolved nutrient concentrations. The community structures patterns from samples collected in spring were most associated with latitude and net average primary production rates. Comparisons between cruises indicated that season was a greater predictor of prokaryotic community composition than geographic location, coincident with findings from previous research on this region. We also observed light stimulated bacterial 3H-leucine incorporation during the autumn cruise but not during the spring cruise. Supporting this observation, relative abundances of prokaryotes containing rhodopsin genes were greater in all autumn DNA samples, compared to rhodopsin abundances in spring samples.

Conversely, lower abundance taxa displayed a bimodal distribution of GS, with a smaller peak in the mesopelagic and a larger peak in the bathypelagic. Opposing trends were observed for protein-encoding gene density and functional diversity across epipelagic and deep ocean MAGs. Specifically, protein-encoding gene density was higher at the epipelagic and decreased towards the bathypelagic for most of the taxa, pointing out that genome streamlining generally holds true, but it is not universal for all microbes. Larger prokaryotic GS in the bathypelagic was associated with a higher prevalence of prophages and defense systems.

Investigating the synchrony and the rhythmicity in the temporal dynamics of microbes populating environmentally similar locations can provide new insights into functional redundancy. When comparing the dynamics of neighbouring microbiomes, high functional redundancy could be depicted by cases where metabolic functions are synchronous over time while the genes or taxa contributing to those functions are not. In turn, low functional redundancy would be exemplified by cases where both functions and genes or taxa are synchronous over time. The same behaviour is predicted for the rhythmicity in each location.

This constitutes the longest freshwater metagenome time series to date. To analyze genomic changes over different time scales, we assembled over 30,000 medium to high quality (&gt;50% complete) genomes. These were de-replicated to produce 2,600 representative genomes reconstructed from a broad diversity of bacteria including the dominant lake lineages. We mapped reads to these genomes to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within individual samples and characterize genomic microdiversity over time. Lake Mendota’s microbial community follows strong phenological patterns, and abundance estimates based on coverage confirmed this. In addition, we observed seasonal patterns in genomic microdiversity, which were frequently not concordant with abundance. For example, one strain of the most abundant bacteria in the lake, the Actinobacteria <em>Nanopelagicus</em> (acI-B), peaked in microdiversity in summer after a spring abundance peak. On top of this genomic phenology, we observed decadal shifts in microdiversity. For example, in another acI-B strain, microdiversity shifted higher at the midpoint of the time series.

Here, we explore the biological and ecological processes, as well as the technical artifacts that lead to functional redundancy in the ocean’s microbiome. Specifically, we investigate patterns of functional redundancy across methods, spatial and temporal scales, and environments to understand its multi-scale drivers and potential effects on ecosystems. We found that, globally, redundancy in biogeochemical functions was driven by temperature, with lower values in the poles and deep-sea layers. More specifically, redundancy was variable in multiple steps of the Carbon, Nitrogen, and Sulfur cycles with some steps showing low redundancy. The latter points to specific areas of marine metabolic networks that may be particularly vulnerable to global change. Finally, using predictions of environmental conditions and machine learning, we estimate the redundancy of microbial functions in the year 2100 under various climate change scenarios.

Lifestyle preferences were important: PA showed higher Shannon diversity than FL bacteria, with these differences being especially obvious during the wet year. Finally, beta diversity was greater during the wet year, and in FL bacteria. These patterns were mostly driven by lake area, salinity and total phosphorus. Given their high collinearity, more research is needed to disentangle the relative role of each of these variables.

These studies showed that the seagrass microbiome varies according to the host species, health status of the meadow and environmental changes. In this investigation, we focussed on the changes experienced by the microbial community associated with populations of the marine angiosperm <em>Zostera marina</em> exposed to nutrient inputs of different intensity. A multifactorial experimental design was adopted with zone and nutrient inputs as factors. The experiment was carried out in two zones of the Ría de Vigo (Spain): the highly anthropized Bouzas beach and the moderately anthropized area of Cesantes. A high nutrient input treatment was achieved by pounding six 60 cm cylindrical core filled with nutrients that were released to the surrounding environment for 4 months. Adjacent control areas with no nutrient inputs and procedural controls were established. Sampling of the microbiome associated with <em>Zostera marina</em> was conducted in different stages of the seagrass growing season (March, April and July). Prokaryotic community composition from leaves and roots was assessed by sequencing the hypervariable V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. In this communication, the differences in the composition of the <em>Z. marina</em> microbiome associated with contrasting baseline anthropization levels as well as the response of these communities to enhanced nutrient stress are presented and discussed in the context of seagrass regression caused by eutrophication processes.",4,361,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Using rRNA gene operon copy number as a proxy for maximum growth rate, we show that higher seawater temperatures universally favor slower-growing taxa. This is in agreement with theoretical predictions from a previously validated Lotka-Volterra competition model, showing that increasing temperatures have the effect of decreasing the mortality burden more for the slower-growing taxa compared to the faster-growing ones. Importantly, changes in bacterial community structure promoted by temperature are independent from variations in nutrient concentrations along spatial and temporal gradients.

Here we investigated the taxonomic and functional turnover of diatom communities along the oceanic currents that flow from the Gulf Stream to the AO through the NAO. We explored the taxonomic composition and similarity between communities populating the surface of Tara Oceans sampling stations using metabarcoding markers and analyzed it in the context of the emerging environmental gradients and oceanographic currents.

We showed how diatom communities inhabiting the two oceans are different; we also highlighted the existence of a transition zone between the two systems, a region whose amplitude is expected to increase and extend poleward in the next future. The spatial variation of diatom communities was accompanied by a variation of their overall functional landscape.

However, the seasonality of vitamin auxotrophs and their interplay with the producers on which they depend remain poorly known. Here, we assess the seasonal dynamics of B1 and B12-related prokaryotic communities and their co-occurrence in a Mediterranean coastal site over 7-years. Our metagenomic time series shows a succession of B12 producers with different biosynthesis pathways along the year. Bacteria communities use the aerobic B12 production pathway in summer, and are dominated by HIMB11 and UBA8309, both B1 auxotrophs. In winter, archaea belonging to Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosopelagicus use the anaerobic B12 pathway, and are also able to produce B1 de-novo. Strong co-occurrence patterns between auxotrophs and producers suggest functional complementarity in vitamin requirements between specific microorganisms during vitamin-limited periods. Finally, we show that during environmental perturbations, organisms usually carrying vitamin B12 synthesis genes are replaced by others with the same gene.

Using radiotracer growth experiments and 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic identification, we found that spores in Laptev Shelf sediments show a restricted distribution close to a seep site with a likely thermogenic origin. This non-random distribution implies local hydrothermal and/or thermogenic sources and the presence of a dispersal barrier such as subsea permafrost<sup>5</sup>. Arctic permafrost is thawing due to natural and anthropogenic warming<sup>6</sup>, thereby creating local patches where upward movement and subsequent expulsion of microorganisms, such as spores, from the warm and deep biosphere to the surrounding shelf is possible.

One of the challenges of monitoring AMR organisms and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) is their ubiquitous distribution, from living organisms to natural environments like water, soil and air. In particular, water plays a key role as a vector and reservoir for AMR transmission across urban and rural areas. Our preliminary results suggest that the abundance of AMR in urban waters and sediments is substantially higher compared to rural water bodies. In addition, rural lakes sediments and water derived from farmlands is observed to be a major source of environmental AMR due to frequent antibiotics use for cattle raising. My research project seeks to provide further understanding on AMR distribution in aquatic ecosystems as well as to characterize the humanization of urban water microbiomes. The outcome of this study will allow to directly link frequency and diversity of AMR and the carrying bacteria, providing a broad overview of AMR profiles in different aquatic environments from the area of Berlin-Brandenburg.",12,351,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Despite the rapid expansion of seaweed farming, a major factor limiting the productivity of seaweed aquaculture in the mesotrophic waters of the North Atlantic, is the proliferation of biofouling organisms on the seaweed blades. This unwanted growth results in increased processing costs, decreased product value and risks for public health. Target biofouling species include invertebrates and algae, which settle from the plankton as larvae or spores respectively. Despite the obvious challenges, solutions are possible by carefully planning the harvesting time, location/depth and species of the farmed seaweed. In this study, data were collected during a full production cycle from a Scottish seaweed farm. &nbsp;Epibionts (including meroplanktonic zooplankton and epiphytic algae) were monitored from their early life stages by combining microscopy (zooplankton, phytoplankton and epibionts from the blades) and molecular approaches (environmental DNA metabarcoding and epibionts barcoding). Succession patterns of epibionts were observed during the studied period and lags were identified as well as variation in the intensity of biofouling by depth. This information can be paramount for predicting, preventing, and mitigating biofouling in seaweed aquaculture to safeguard the economic viability of the industry.",0,365,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Monitoring environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, salinity, nutrients and irradiance) and biofouling organisms in a seaweed farm is important for making decisions related to growth optimisation. Deployment of underwater robots for line inspection, in combination with “deep-learning” approaches, have the power to provide a fast and reliable estimation of seaweed biomass. Here, we show state-of-the-art, yet cost-effective, and scalable technologies aimed at optimising monitoring in a Norwegian kelp farm. Robotic monitoring of kelp farms, including biomass growth, was assessed using a mini, cost-effective, remotely operated vehicle (ROV). For a fast and reliable estimation of kelp biomass, a robust set of images to build a data-centric machine learning platform was collected, where we developed computer vision applications supported by AI algorithms. Preliminary results from the <em>MoniTARE</em> project showed that there is a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.85) between the ground-truth biomass (manually collected) and the biomass inferred through 2D computer vision techniques from recorded images.

In this study, we investigate the spatial variability in ecosystem responses to seaweed cultivation in the Dutch North Sea in designated wind development areas.

We integrated a module simulating seaweed nutrient uptake and growth dynamics into a fully coupled 3D hydrodynamic-water quality model of the North Sea. We ran different cultivation scenarios over a production year and compared them to a run without seaweed cultivation. Results showed that significant upscaling of seaweed production (around 800 km<sup>2</sup><sub>)</sub> in part of the designated areas for offshore wind development would have a strong impact on the ecology, with local decreases in spring phytoplankton production as high as 30%.

Implementation poses huge engineering challenges and potential benefits. From all seaweeds, there is one that is particularly suited for open-ocean aquaculture. Holopelagic sargassum is a free-floating brown seaweed that rapidly divides by fragmentation, is very efficient at carbon uptake per unit of nutrient provided and creates a nursery habitat for diverse species. Its biomass is already converted into&nbsp;fossil-fuel replacing products (eg. fertilizers, emulsifiers and bioplastic). Aquafarming sargassum in nutrient replete areas will provide a stable feedstock for this nascent industry. To upscale production to the Gt scale, giant off-shore aquafarms can be created in the&nbsp;subtropical gyres. For fertilization, we investigated artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water by harnessing salinity and temperature gradients.&nbsp;Our recent engineering advances on aquafarming barriers, model-based understanding of artificial upwelling pipes, and new discoveries on sargassums nutrient requirements, confirm the feasibility of sargassum aquafarming. Our study shows that combining artificial upwelling with seaweed aquafarming can alleviate some of the environmental impacts such as nutrient robbing.&nbsp;The formation of low oxygen areas in the deep sea, can be mitigated by processing and baling the biomass before sinking.

We found significant increases in epibiont abundance and diversity on farmed kelps over and beyond their growing season, reaching over 6000 individuals and 9 taxa present per kelp&nbsp;by late season.&nbsp;We found farmed kelps supported 16 times the abundance of epibionts living on wild kelps at harvest time, however, taxonomic diversity per kelp was lower at the farm. Farmed kelp assemblages were dominated by amphipods, which were present on the wild kelps but in much lower numbers. Farmed kelp also supported distinct assemblages to cultivated mussels, which&nbsp;hosted higher relative abundances of crabs, echinoderms, worms and red algal biomass. We found higher abundances of fish at the farm site compared to control areas, several of which are of commercial importance including pollock (<em>Pollachius pollachius</em>) and mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>).

Understanding how climate change impacts on thermal and hydrological regimes may affect nutrient dynamics and transport to coastal areas is crucial for implementing effective management strategies to mitigate eutrophication in human-impacted watersheds, such as the Po River basin (northern Italy). The present work addresses the long-term trends (1992-2020) of nitrogen export to the Adriatic Sea by investigating its relationship with water temperature and discharge trajectories. Despite the constant nitrogen surplus on arable land, a marked decrease in nitrogen export, mainly as nitrate, was recorded in the last decade compared to the 1990s. The reduction of nitrogen loads in all seasons was probably related to an increased metabolic capacity of the river, triggered by warming water temperatures. An extended seasonal window of warm temperatures and the persistence of low-flow conditions are likely to stimulate denitrification and create favourable conditions for permanent nitrate removal, resulting in reduced delivery to the sea from spring to early autumn, when the risk of eutrophication is higher. The present outcomes suggest that temperature warming due to climate change would unexpectedly increase nitrogen processing efficiency, thereby reducing export from catchments and partially buffering eutrophication.",4,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Sala Menorca B,

Meanwhile, benthic aquatic invertebrates modify fluxes by burrowing into anoxic sediments which alters sediment oxygen conditions, sediment microbial processes, and sediment-water nutrient exchange rates. We compared bioturbation-mediated nutrient fluxes measured at the patch scale to ambient internal loading and estimated their contribution to whole-ecosystem nutrient budgets. We measured ambient flux rates in spring/summer and benthic invertebrate densities across the bay monthly from Apr to Sept. We completed a lab experiment with bioturbator additions to ascertain bioturbation-mediated nutrient flux rates. We found that ambient fluxes differ greatly based on water oxygen conditions and season, and that bioturbators contribute phosphorus and nitrogen to surface water in this system.

Most explanations for this change invoke a decline and/or change in phytoplankton production and diversity caused by decreasing nutrient inputs, increasing sea surface temperatures, or ocean acidification. As of yet, the changes affecting the phytoplankton community in the region remain relatively unconstrained. Here, we explore the use of deep-learning algorithms to study the changes in phytoplankton production and bloom dynamics in the Mediterranean Sea. We apply automated microscopy imaging to the&nbsp;record of nanno- and microplankton shells retrieved from a sediment trap series in the Gulf of Lions between 2010 and 2018.&nbsp;We use a machine learning-based workflow for calcareous nannoplankton classification to study the changes in species abundance, size, and calcification; we explore a novel workflow to study the siliceous microplankton record (diatoms, silicoflagellates). Our results show a decrease in overall coccolith production and mass over the interval of study, and a growing proportion of deep-dwelling species in the total coccolith assemblage. These results suggest increasing oligotrophic conditions in the Gulf of Lions which can, at this stage, be attributed to increasing column stratification in the region.

In this study, microbial community dynamics in the tidal freshwater and brackish zones of the Zeeschelde estuary (Belgium) were assessed from 2002 to 2021. Our analyses revealed that while de-eutrophication efforts and morphological interventions in the estuary were the dominant drivers of phytoplankton dynamics during the 2000s and 2010s, respectively, major shifts in community composition were triggered by extreme weather events. Metabarcoding analysis using the 16S rRNA gene for prokaryotes and the 18S rRNA gene for eukaryotes showed that the mean relative abundance of phototrophs decreased from the freshwater to the brackish zone, while phagotrophs and parasites followed the opposite pattern, dominating in the maximum turbidity zone. Similarly, free-living bacteria were dominant in upstream section of the estuary where phytoplankton dominated, while particle-attached bacteria and bacterial taxa involved in nitrogen cycling were more abundant in areas with more sediments in suspension.

However, although the viral dynamics and the spatial distribution are being studied, little is known about the temporal fluctuations of the viral community. Furthermore, climate change and its impacts on the environment may have consequences on the temporal dynamics of viruses and their potential hosts. One of the best approaches to study this occurrence is to have continuous time series with large datasets.&nbsp; During the last 20 years we have been collecting samples for viral abundances and other biological and environmental variables at the Blanes Microbial Observatory (BBMO, Catalan Coast). In this study we use time series analysis and Machine Learning approaches to assess and understand whether the environmental factors have changed along these 20 years, and if they have an effect on viral communities and their hosts. Our results showed that in the BBMO during this period, temperature, salinity and water transparency increased, while phosphate, chlorophyll concentration, bacterial and viral abundance decreased. This suggests an ongoing ecosystem transition towards oligotrophy. In particular, the last decade has been decisive for these changes and their influence on the (decreasing) viral abundance.

Our previous works regarding a large lake and a mesocosm study showed a positive relationship between the variability of phytoplankton composition and mean temperature, which might be a sign of warming-stimulated instability in ecosystem processes. To elucidate whether these observations are unique instances or part of a general phenomenon, we combined a numerical model describing the dependence of algal growth on temperature and nutrient concentration with a multispecies, multi-nutrient model. Using this coupled model, we ran simulations to represent changes in phytoplankton communities with randomized initial species composition under different temperature scenarios (current annual temperature pattern increased with 1, 2 or 3°C), various levels of nitrogen and phosphorus supply and different degrees of temporal variability in those supplies. The model outputs showed that temporal variability in composition can be enhanced by warming through the mechanistic links between nutrient availability, temperature and species-specific growth rates, but the rate of increase is dependent on the N:P ratio and on the size and diversity of the species pool.

Due to its long water exchange time, shallow depth and low salinity, the effects in the Baltic Sea happen earlier and stronger than in other seas. For instance, the Baltic Sea has already faced temperature and salinity fluctuations that most other seas will only experience in the future. These changes alter zooplankton communities in terms of community composition or functional diversity with a reported shift towards smaller organisms and a loss of zooplankton biomass. Ultimately, changes in zooplankton community composition can alter the functioning of the biological carbon pump in terms of carbon uptake, transport and export as the potential decrease in zooplankton size could weaken the transport of organic material to the seafloor. In this study, zooplankton data from the long-term monitoring site Tvärminne Storfjärden in the Gulf of Finland, northern Baltic Sea, spanning 55 years, are analysed to identify changes in zooplankton community composition and model future developments.

Our results show that copepods peak in synchrony with the summer cyanobacterial bloom and are decoupled from the highly productive spring phytoplankton blooms that tend to appear earlier. Driven by the offset with spring phytoplankton bloom, magnitudes of <em>Pseudocalanus</em>, an important copepod prey for fish, has decreased over the study period. Being coupled to the spring phytoplankton, the bloom magnitudes of the rotifer <em>Synchaeta</em> were also driven by the offset with the spring bloom. These two zooplankton have an important role in niche differentiation for planktivorous fish, thus earlier spring blooms might affect transfer efficiencies to higher trophic levels. We also find an extension of the productive season with newly developing diatom blooms in autumn, supporting secondary production later in the season. Our study highlights that spring phytoplankton blooms are more responsive to climate forcing than summer phytoplankton and zooplankton.

We leveraged gradient boosted regression trees and limited observations of dissolved oxygen and argon measured via membrane inlet mass spectrometry to decouple physical and biological oxygen cycling in a four-year time series of optical dissolved oxygen in the near-shore Southern California Bight system. We then used these data to train a random forest model of phytoplankton and bacterial community structure from the Scripps Ecological Observatory to predict net trophic status over a five-year period. Our results show cyclic patterns in trophic status and overall net heterotrophy across the study period. We identified key taxa driving periods of net heterotrophy and net autotrophy, providing further insight into the role of microbial community structure on carbon and oxygen fluxes. Our work provides a framework for estimating net trophic status in dynamic, productive ecosystems essential in the global marine ecosystem response to climate change using widespread and accessible measurements of optical dissolved oxygen and microbial community structure.",2,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

Six bimonthly field campaigns were carried out in 2022 at three sites: Bahía Solano (rocky shores), Nuquí (intermediate conditions), and Pizarro (estuarine, soft bottoms). Species richness was similar at the three sites (66-70 spp.), but abundance was higher in Pizarro (1.5-16 times than Solano, 1.2-6 times than Nuquí). At Pizarro, <em>Cetengraulis mysticetus</em> was the dominant species (12-90%). In Solano, larvae of <em>Eucinostomus</em> sp., <em>Caranx sexfasciatus</em>, and six Scombridae alternated their dominance. Nuquí was dominated by <em>C. mysticetus </em>(11-31%), <em>Eucinostomus</em> sp., and <em>Auxis rochei</em>. Fish larvae abundance was inversely correlated with surface salinity (Spearman rank correlation, ρ = -0.41, p&lt;0.0001) and positively with surface chlorophyll (ρ = 0.38, p&lt;0.0001). Likely, the higher chlorophyll values at Pizarro favored the dominance of <em>C. mysticetus, </em>which is predominantly a filter-feeder, and particularly in November during its spawning period. In contrast, fish larvae abundance at Solano was higher during the upwelling season (Jan-Apr), when mesozooplankton biomass was also highest. Likely, this favored a higher proportion of carnivorous fish larvae. Our study highlights the importance of estuarine, soft-bottom environments as nursery grounds for small pelagic fishes that are valuable for industrial fisheries, and environments dominated by rocky shores for the growth of species valuable for the regional artisanal fisheries.",0,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

This high cryptic diversity evolved through parallel evolution in different linages. However, its ecological significance remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of heat waves and salinization on growth and competition between cryptic taxa affiliated with the clades C1, C2 and C3 within Ochromonadales (in particular <em>Spumella </em>spp., <em>Pedospumella </em>spp. and<em> Poteriospumella </em>spp.). We designed the FISH probes O1C531, O2C613 and O3C723 targeting the C1-, C2-, and C3-clade, respectively, to identify and quantify each taxa when grown together in mixed cultures. Increased salinity significantly decreased growth rates for all three taxa. An increase in temperature, however, stimulate particularly the growth of <em>Poteriospumella lacustris</em> (member of C3-clade). <em>P. laucstris</em> showed a high competitive strength, which resulted in a shift of community composition in mixed cultures. Our results suggest that morphological similarities may mask a turn-over of cryptic species differently adapted to abiotic factors. Since predator-prey interactions largely correlate with morphology, such a turn-over of cryptic species may stabilize microbial food webs facing environmental change.",24,372,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, anthropogenic effects on the seasonal cycle alter the composition and diversity of phytoplankton communities, which can have a cascading impact on carbon flows and storages in coastal ecosystems. Our study focuses on the effect of phytoplankton community seasonal change on the carbon cycle in the Baltic Sea. We collected samples roughly every other week, for one year, from two stations in the coastal Gulf of Finland to follow the changes in phytoplankton composition and evenness and estimate the pelagic carbon stock. In addition, we deployed sediment traps&nbsp;every season&nbsp;to assess carbon export to the seafloor. The spring phytoplankton community was dominated by diatom species (95%), which potentially results in higher carbon transport to the seafloor due to their high sinking velocity. The summer and autumn communities consisted mainly of&nbsp;cyanobacteria (63%) which can form high biomass, but have low sinking potential allowing for higher carbon emission to the atmosphere. The highest POC/PON ratio occured during February (9.6 mol/mol) and lowest values were measured in November (2.1 mol/mol), suggesting the highest carbon accumulation in the water column in spring.Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of phytoplankton community composition to the carbon cycle dynamics and highlights the need for seasonal monitoring to fully understand the carbon transport from pelagic communities in coastal areas.",14,402,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Availability of EPA and DHA affects secondary production and the nutritional quality of fish for human consumption. The production of EPA and DHA is primarily taxon-specific, and the secondary influence of environmental stressors on phytoplankton community EPA and DHA concentrations are not fully understood. Additionally, the proximate reasons for EPA and DHA dynamics are unresolved, i.e., the relative importance of changes in phytoplankton community composition versus taxon-specific ecophysiological adaptation. We studied the combined effects of warming and eutrophication on phytoplankton EPA and DHA concentrations in mesocosms in Lemming, Denmark. Nutrient concentrations affected EPA and DHA concentrations more than warming, mainly because the overall phytoplankton biomass was constrained by nutrient availability in oligotrophic conditions. Our results showed that phytoplankton EPA and DHA dynamics were mainly coupled with changes in phytoplankton biomass and community composition, with the abundance of diatoms alone explaining ~59 % of the variation in EPA and DHA concentrations. These findings suggest that ecophysiological adaptation of phytoplankton is less important predictor for EPA and DHA dynamics than changes in the community composition. Our results also imply that declining diatom biomass due to eutrophication or climate change will decrease the overall availability of EPA and DHA to consumers.",20,401,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

To monitor their dietary conditions, we investigated annual variations of copepod abundance in association with hydrographic conditions along a latitudinal transect at the shelf edge of the northern East China Sea (31º45'N, 126º45'E–128º15'E, nine stations) in June 2002–2019. During the survey, mean surface salinity gradually decreased from 33.46 to 30.77. Contrastively, the surface temperature gradually increased from 2011 to 2019 after dropping from 2004 to 2011. Accordingly, stratification was progressively intensified throughout the survey, gradually decreasing surface nitrate to below 0.1 µM. The abundance of dominant copepods, including Oithonidae, Paracalanidae, Oncaeidae, and Clausocalanidae, gradually decreased in association with the uplift of surface temperature. By contrast, the abundance of Calanidae (mainly <em>Calanus sinicus</em>) increased with the decrease in surface salinity. This population of <em>C. sinicus</em> was composed primarily of the fourth, fifth, and sixth copepodites, which suggests that they were not actively reproducing in this area. This population may be mainly transported from other areas, probably near the Chinese coast, and increased abundance by increased freshwater supplies from the continent. These facts imply complex responses of copepod assemblage against hydrographic conditions, including forthcoming climate changes in the East China Sea.",2,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

In globally important primary producers like phytoplankton, the interaction between abiotic (e.g. resource supply) and biotic (e.g. herbivore grazing) mechanisms determines growth and loss processes through resource competition and trophic interactions, which are mediated by important morphological traits like size. Here, we harnessed four years of hourly data from an underwater dual-magnification darkfield microscope, combined with ancillary monitoring sensors, to study the relative importance of grazers, water physic and chemistry on the abundances of six phytoplankton size-based groups, obtained by binning individuals on a log10 axis of individual area. Using a random forest modelling approach, we found more support for biotic than for abiotic controls of abundances across the entire data set and time. Nevertheless, abiotic controls, and especially their timing, were important, particularly for larger phytoplankton forms. Trophic control was strongest in bins of small cells. The effects on abundances of size bins were mainly non linear with shapes of the response curves often suggesting complex indirect effects. These findings have implications for both understanding the controls of phytoplankton biodiversity and for theory development in the field of plankton ecology.",8,391,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, morphology-based microscopic approaches are insufficient to identify small flagellates (2-10 µm) due to their insufficient distinguishable morphological features. This leads to a considerable lack of ecological insights into this taxonomically diverse functional guild. Here, we present a combination of CARD-FISH and environmental sequence analyses, which revealed that majority of cryptophytes are aplastidic and bacterivorous in diverse freshwater ecosystems of the world. Aplastidic cryptophytes, due to their small size are morphologically indistinguishable and are so far largely cryptic and uncultured. Using probes for Cryptophyceae and its heterotrophic CRY1 lineage, we analyzed 24 freshwater lakes spanning a broad range of trophic states, sizes and geographical locations. Aplastidic cryptophytes and CRY1 lineage accounted for ca. 2/3 and ¼ of total HNF, respectively, in both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic samples. Aplastidic cryptophytes have high uptake rates of bacteria and contribute predominantly to bacterial mortality rates. The worldwide ubiquity of Cryptophyceae and CRY1 lineage was supported by 18S rRNA gene sequence analyses of 297 freshwater metagenomes. We succeeded in culturing some aplastidic cryptophytes, which will provide insights into their ecophysiological traits.

We sequenced and analysed V1-V2 16S rRNA gene amplicons using primers that capture both eukaryotic phytoplankton and cyanobacteria. Microbial alpha diversity showed greater variation within salt ponds, salterns, and mangroves compared to reef, off-reef, and open sea environments. Among eukaryotic phytoplankton, stramenopiles exhibited the highest relative abundances in mangrove forests, reefs, off-reef, and open sea environments, where cyanobacteria also showed high relative abundances. Within stramenopiles, diatom amplicons dominated in salt ponds and mangroves, while dictyochophytes and pelagophytes prevailed above reefs and offshore. Green algae and cryptophytes were also present and the former exhibited transitions following the gradient from inland to offshore, wherein chlorophytes and prasinophyte class IV dominated in salt ponds, whereas prasinophyte Class II, including several <em>Micromonas</em> and <em>Ostreococcus </em>species, had the highest relative abundances of green algae in mangroves, above-reef, off-reef, and the open sea.

Current research highlights that not only feeding interactions but also symbiotic ones are prominent in plankton communities. However, plankton parasites are often not included in current food web models and ecological studies. Parasites play a remarkable role in trophic transmission and they contribute to global biogeochemical cycles. The role of plankton parasites in the food web interactions has been often overseen because the parasites are hiding inside the body cavities and guts of their hosts, and consequently, are often difficult to detect. We studied host-specific parasite infections in marine crustacean zooplankton, using DNA metabarcoding of 18S rRNA sequencing in different habitats along the Baltic Sea. The hypothesis was that the putative protist parasites in the order of Syndiniales have species-specific interactions with different zooplankton species. We discovered high Syndiniales infection rates in designated zooplankton taxa, which differ between hosts and habitats. To link the interactions with the environmental factors we test if eutrophication, oxygen concentration, salinity or host density affect these results. Additional further analysis by using flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) will provide more insight into the importance of the zooplankton-parasite interactions on the marine ecosystem functioning.",27,382,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Here, we combine data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey with a standardised network clustering procedure to refine the copepod species-based bioregions documented at the North Atlantic scale, and identify functionally distinct units. As CPR data are collected at sub-surface, we consider day and night samples separately in the analysis. We show that bioregions are rather resilient from 1960 to 2020, but detect the triggering of the abrupt biological shift that occurred in the North Sea in the 1980s and the ensuing biological reorganisation of copepod communities. Significant differences between night and day patterns are observed, highlighting that variations of copepod communities are also strongly driven by species ecological traits, such as diel vertical migration behaviour. To better decipher the ecological processes underpinning biogeographic patterns and their links to ecosystem functioning, we propose that biogeographic analyses should take into account ecological traits, and not only species abundance or diversity.

Laboratory mesocosms were used to test the vertical migration behavior of &lt;em&gt;P. texanum&lt;/em&gt; in normal oxic conditions and hypoxic conditions. The cells were recorded throughout their diurnal cycle to quantify their concentrations in varying salinity and dissolved oxygen levels. Results have shown cell concentrations increase at depth after sunset, consistent with prior work that suggests some species of dinoflagellates migrate downwards in the water column at night to maximize nutrient absorption. In hypoxic mesocosms, cells concentrated at depth during daylight hours when nutrients were present, opposite of the same nutrient treatment in oxic mesocosms. With climate change increasing the duration and frequency of hypoxic events, harmful algal blooms could become enhanced if cells benefit from the presence of hypoxia. Further, longer-term phytoplankton community dynamics may shift due to the ability of some species to take advantage of the hypoxic layer.",30,375,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

We find alterations not only in the range of the pico-phytoplankton in a warmer world, but also changes in the distinct types of communities and their seasonal cycling.

We used selective DNA metabarcoding of targeted consumer species and integrate these findings in network models to quantify plankton interactions. Our data show that zooplankton exhibit differential feeding strategies that vary among species and location but also between seasons and depth strata. Detritivores, filter feeders and secondary uptake play important roles. Moreover, we find that a large fraction of cyanobacteria production is being efficiently channeled to zooplankton, which is driven by both specific feeding selectivity of the zooplankton consumers and a temporal match between the annual zooplankton and cyanobacteria peak. These results stress the importance of considering the diverse feeding strategies of zooplankton in food web models. Moreover, this new finding represents a fundamental revision in our understanding of the functional role of cyanobacteria by revealing that cyanobacteria make a significant contribution to secondary production beyond that coming from dinoflagellates and diatoms.",1,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

Based on these morphs, we computed time-series of morphological diversity indices (richness, divergence and evenness) relaying to metrics originally developed for functional diversity. Over the 12-year period, morphological – but not taxonomic – diversity increased while zooplankton concentration decreased. The environmental changes during this period consisted mainly in an increase in temperature and salinity and an overall impoverishment of surface waters, suggesting that niche specialization under low productivity increased the morphological divergence.

Annual salmon return rates in the west of the UK/Ireland are correlated with ZED&nbsp;along the shelf-edge spring migration route and over a large swath of the Northeast Atlantic, where ZED&nbsp;has declined 15%/decade since the 1980s. Gradients in sandeel length in the North Sea likewise reflect both regional differences and long-term trends in ZED. Surprisingly, the decline of ZED&nbsp;in the region of the clearest sandeel decline (the western North Sea) has not been driven by changes in&nbsp;<em>Calanus</em>&nbsp;spp. but by the steady disappearance of the smallest, poorest-value prey in the sandeel diet. This highlights the importance of resolving the entire zooplankton size spectrum, as in a new North Sea implementation of the trait-based model Coltrane. A mechanistic model of sandeel foraging and growth demonstrates that total zooplankton energy is a quite incomplete predictor of how forage fish may respond to complex prey fields once one takes into account visual search, optimal prey selection, and bioenergetics.",0,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

Species Abundance Distribution (SAD) have been used to understand the mechanisms underlying community assembly as they describe the abundance distribution of each species in a community, and reflects at the same time community richness, evenness and dissimilarity. We use rank abundance distributions (RADs) to investigate how community structure responds to environmental abiotic and biotic gradients over time. Specifically, we analyse long-term datasets of 13 alpine and peri-alpine lakes in Europe to study RAD changes in phytoplankton communities across time, in relation to nutrients, temperature and predation pressure. To better understand the empirical results, we develop a mathematical model to predict how changes in the environment shape the rank abundance distributions. While changes in the shape of RADs are positively correlated to temperature, changes in other drivers, such as nutrients and zooplankton, do not always result in a universal trend in RADs among lakes. Overall, we find that RADs have a common seasonal pattern in freshwater bodies. To conclude, we demonstrate that SADs can describe changes in community structure and predict potential drivers of these changes.",13,376,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

One of the major limitations on phytoplankton production in the global ocean is grazing by microzooplankton. While there are well known factors (e.g., light availability, turbulence, nutrients, and temperature) that impact phytoplankton abundance and distribution, factors that drive microzooplankton grazing pressures are more poorly constrained. Estuaries are subject to large seasonal variation in abiotic factors such as temperature and biotic factors such as plankton species assemblages, making them an ideal area to study what drives microzooplankton grazing rates. To distinguish the drivers of grazing rates and their effect on phytoplankton, rates of microzooplankton grazing and phytoplankton growth were measured weekly using the two-point dilution method in Narraganset Bay estuary in Rhode Island, USA from February 2022 to February 2023. Over the course of the year, temperature ranged from 0°C to 24°C and chlorophyll concentration varied from 0.81 to 23.82 ug L<sup>-1</sup>. Microzooplankton grazing rates varied widely.

This region is impacted by wind-driven upwelling and is part of the productive Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS). EBUS have crucial importance for climate control and fishing, but the IPCC predicts varying regional impacts of climate change on these systems. Efforts have been made to understand the climate variability and the response of marine ecosystems to environmental change in the Iberian Margin during the late Pleistocene, in particular, using microfossil assemblages preserved in the sedimentary record. However, many uncertainties remain about the possible impact of ongoing warming on primary production in the Portuguese continental margin. To shed light on this issue and improve predictions of future responses to environmental change, here we reconstruct the variability of primary production over the past millennium through detailed analysis of the nannoplankton assemblages preserved in different settings on the Portuguese continental margin. Another objective is to differentiate between increased primary production caused by upwelling and river-derived nutrients. To create the coccolithophores time series, we used sediment cores from offshore the Douro (PO287-06-2G) and Tagus (PO287-26-1B &amp; 3G) rivers, and off Faro in the Algarve (POPEI-VC2B).

Even in oligotrophic waters, there are over a billion per cubic meter. Consequently, observations consider only a tiny fraction of the whole community, whatever the technique. Given this large number of individuals, an alternative view to the seasonal replacement of species is the stable non-equilibrium coexistence of many species in a fluctuating environment. The necessary condition for stable coexistence is that all species should show positive long-term average growth rates. Inequalities related to relative fitness (i.e., competitive ability) are compensated by stabilizing niche differentiation. In an oligotrophic context, we may hypothesize that lower affinity for a limiting nutrient can be compensated by growth differentiation according to seasonal fluctuating non-limiting nutrients.

Here, we assessed seasonal and intra-seasonal variation in growth rate of three dominant copepods in the upwelling zone of central-southern Chile (36°S) using field data combined with in situ simulated experiments. Growth rate (g) was monthly estimated with the egg production method and associated with prevailing wind-driven upwelling assessed by estimates of Ekman transport, water column stratification €, and in situ measurements of temperature (T), salinity (S), dissolved oxygen (DO), Chlorophyll-a (Chla) and phytoplankton composition. C-specific g of copepods varied in the range of 0.05-0.18 1/d with significant differences between species, and showed a significant correlation with E and DO, but not with Chla nor T. The seasonal pattern of g was unclear and did not follow the upwelling cycle either.

This study looked at the influence of penguin guano, as a proxy for a nearby predator and a negative chemical stimulus, on: krill swimming behaviour and kinematics in a horizontal flume and on krill ingestion, grazing and feeding rates. Krill had a higher frequency of acute turns when guano was present meaning they were unable to maintain a heading. Krill also varied their swimming speeds more when guano was present, showing a distinct pattern of bimodal swimming. These are both indicators of avoidance behaviour to the negative chemical cues represented by penguin guano. Similarly, krill’s ingestion rates significantly dropped in the presence of guano, even with an increase in algal density. This study has shown for the first time that the presence of a negative chemical stimulus as a proxy for a predator, such as guano, can not only dampen the feeding rates of krill but it can make them exhibit clear avoidance swimming behaviour as well.",3,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

Data from 2018 to 2021 of water temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrients, wave height, air temperature and pressure, wind speed, and absolute and relative abundance of <em>L. polyedra</em> (via microscopy cell counts and 18S rRNA gene sequences) from the Scripps Pier were used to compare these two common HAB monitoring methods and investigate factors contributing to <em>L. polyedra</em> blooms. A total of 22 amplicon sequence variants were associated with <em>L. polyedra</em>, but one variant was responsible for most of the counts. A linear regression between <em>L. polyedra</em> relative abundances given by the molecular and microscopy methods revealed that the approaches mostly agreed (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6). Differences between the methods can be explained by limitations of each one and characteristics of the studied taxon. We then applied a self-organizing map of environmental physico-chemical data to understand what conditions lead to blooms. Superimposed on the map, the most significant blooms were clustered together and associated with water column stratification and surface nutrient depletion. We hypothesize that these conditions favor <em>L. polyedra</em> due to its ability to migrate vertically and uptake nutrients in deeper waters, below the nutricline.",26,388,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Increased phytoplankton growth near tidewater glaciers has been observed in a range of locations, but it remains unclear exactly how these systems serve to elevate production.&nbsp;Recent work has suggested that both glacial meltwater and upwelled deeper marine waters brought to the surface by buoyant submarine discharge plumes may provide polar phytoplankton with essential nutrients throughout the summer. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a novel incubation experiment in Ausuittuq (Grise Fiord), Nunavut during summer 2021 to uncover how Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) phytoplankton respond to different glacier-derived nutrient sources. Here, phytoplankton were supplied with glacial meltwater and/or deep seawater representing meltwater and upwelled nutrients respectively, and were monitored for chlorophyll a, nutrient consumption, and protein expression patterns. Phytoplankton exposed to deep water exhibited chlorophyll&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;concentrations that were four times higher than treatments exposed to meltwater only. These results suggest that the success of CAA phytoplankton near tidewater glaciers is largely due to upwelled macronutrients.

We investigated the response of zooplankton communities to HABs across reservoirs spanning a productivity gradient in the Intermountain West, USA. We quantified zooplankton diversity, size structure, and biomass with respect to baseline physicochemical factors related to HABs.

The global biodiversity crisis affects in particular freshwater ecosystems. It is hence crucial to understand the consequences of a loss in functional diversity on phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions. In this context, trait-based approaches are particularly useful to investigate how the loss of specific functional traits (rather than taxa) impacts ecosystem functioning. We here used a combination of controlled laboratory and field mesocosm experiments to investigate the consequences of losses in phytoplankton trait diversity on the pelagic plant-herbivore interface. We demonstrate that phytoplankton trait distributions are affected by both physical (hydrodynamic disturbance) and biological (size-selective zooplankton grazing) factors. In turn, these alterations in phytoplankton trait distributions feed back on the algal nutritional quality for herbivorous zooplankton. This trait-based approach therefore allowed us to highlight the intricate regulation mechanisms between fitness-relevant phytoplankton and zooplankton traits of lakes in a changing world.",3,,6/8/23 15:00,6/8/23 16:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

DIET SHIFT ASSOCIATED WITH NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY IN CARNIVOROUS PLANT UTRICULARIA SPP.,"Oligotrophic wetlands are important sources of drinking water and unique biodiversity. However, they are increasingly threatened by nutrient-enrichment driven by anthropogenic activities. Decrease in number of traps in aquatic carnivorous plants &lt;em&gt;Utricularia&lt;/em&gt; spp. (bladderworts) suggested the shift from carnivory to autotrophy (Nprey) when wetland nutrient became available. Thus, Nprey in bladderworts could be a potential bioindicator for wetland degradation. However, conventional stable isotope mixing model (RPM) failed to give reasonable Nprey<sub> </sub>estimations. Here, we developed two new models (FSM1 and FSM2) to address the association between bladderwort Nprey and wetland nutrient availabilities. The nitrogen (N) stable isotopes composition (&amp;delta&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) of bladderworts and N sources were analyzed across 11 ponds in NSW, Australia, and used to calculate Nprey in RPM, FSM1 and FSM2, respectively.

This tool is based on a scale isotopic discrimination at each step of trophic transfer due to almost the same degree of deamination flux of amino acids (which correlates life energy production) for diverse species. However, some species have a symbiotic partnership between two organisms of different species, which benefits energetically from living together for survival, adaptation, etc., to environments. If this is the case, the degree of trophic isotopic discrimination potentially changes under symbiosis. Our studies are therefore focusing on investigating the effects of symbiosis on the trophic isotopic discrimination, particularly for the symbiosis between anemone and clownfish: they supply great protection to each other against enemies but without trophic interaction between them. Control-feeding experiments reveal that (1) they are trophically independent of the others, (2)&nbsp;clownfish&nbsp;have the scale trophic isotopic discrimination from their diets (e.g., 7.5 permil for glutamic acid) under symbiosis, (3) the isotopic discrimination is however largely expanded by 2-5 permil if clownfish live alone.

However, because it is difficult quantitatively to trace the fate of symbiont-derived photosynthate in corals, characterizing the trophic identity of the coral holobiont is still challenging. Indeed, it is unknown whether the trophic position (TP) of coral holobiont accounts for 1 (autotrophy), 2 (herbivory), or between them (mixotrophy) in ecosystems. Here, we carried out compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids to evaluate the TP of corals that grow autotrophically (i.e., symbiont-derived photosynthate is a solo resource for corals) in laboratory aquariums. The isotope ratios determined reveal that there is a large inter- and intra-specific diversity in the TP for the corals: for example, the disc coral <em>Discosoma</em> sp., the toadstool leather coral <em>Sarcophyton </em>sp., and the zoanthid corals (order Zoantharia) have the TP of ~1.5, ~1.8, and ~2.0, respectively, with little diversity within a species, whereas the star polyp <em>Pachyclavularia </em>sp. has the TP ranging from 0.9 to 2.2 and thus shows a large variety in the TP within a species.

Despite lower precision compared to dual-inlet IRMS, our method allows for a high sample throughput, resulting in the fast and reliable determination of a large amount of &amp;epsilon; values. In this study, we applied our O2 stable isotope method to a broad selection of O2 consuming enzymes, to improve our mechanistic understanding of isotopic fractionation of O2 at the enzyme-level. We found that &amp;epsilon; values of flavin-dependent oxidases correlate with the enzymes’ affinities for O2. Furthermore, our data suggest that &amp;epsilon; values differ significantly between flavin- and metal-dependent oxidases and oxygenases.

The intercomparability of ecological or paleo literature data, in particular from different labs, fundamentally depends on how accurate and reproducible CSI-AA data can be over long time frames, with varied users, protocols, and instrumentation. However, to date there are no established CSI-AA reference materials, no common data validation protocols, and no large multi-lab intercalibrations have been conducted. Instead, labs employ a variety of individual approaches, typically based on internal or external standards, while long-term reproducibly is essentially never reported.

This data set represents the output of many users, variations in wet chemistry protocol, and multiple GC-C-IRMS instruments, and therefore likely represents an excellent proxy for reproducibility of a single material between labs. The overall record demonstrates remarkable robustness in both d<sup>15</sup>N and d<sup>13</sup>C data, while at the same time revealing substantial differences for specific AA.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to constrain the isotopic baseline over the broad spatial and temporal scales over which highly migratory fishes move, empirical estimates of TOR are limited, and discerning the contribution of variation in the isotopic baseline from shifts in TL is problematic. Compound-specific analysi§s of amino acids is based on the premise that “source” AA (e.g. Phe, Met) reflect the isotopic baseline with little or no isotope discrimination, whereas “trophic AA” (e.g. Asp, Glu, Ile, Pro, Val) show predictable trophic enrichment.

Applying &nbsp;CSIA-AA for inferring habitat use and migration has been limited although it has some advantages: source AA are not corrected for TL when inferring migration patterns and they presumably retain the isotopic baseline.

Although many copepod species have been traditionally considered as herbivores, they might feed on different food sources (e.g. microzooplankton or marine snow) when available. This diet plasticity can be tracked by changes in zooplankton isotopic composition, as their signature integrates both the changes in the nutrient sources (baseline) and their trophic position (TP). However, the extent to which changes in trophic dynamics of mesozooplankton are driven by any of these factors is poorly understood. With the aim of investigating whether the upwelling intensity affects the nitrogen baseline and trophic indicators of this group, the taxonomic composition of mesozooplankton samples and their nitrogen stable isotope composition (δ<sup>15</sup>N and CSIA-AA) were investigated during two years in a station at the NW Iberian Peninsula. As expected, higher phytoplankton availability during upwelling events induced zooplankton herbivory, resulting in lower TPs. However, variations in the microbial contribution index to TP, computed from CSIA-AA, revealed that the optimal coupling between metazoan and microbial food webs (i.e. 25% microbial contribution) was reached at moderate upwelling intensities, and decreased to low contributions (&lt;15%) in both downwelling and strong upwelling situations. Therefore, enhanced phytoplankton productivity during moderate upwelling disruptions leads to a shorter and more efficient food web.  ",5,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza B,

Here, we used nutrient budgets and stable isotopes to identify the sources and processing of nitrogen in surface and groundwater in a region of intensive irrigated agriculture in Gippsland, Australia. Nitrogen exports from the catchments was estimated to account for slightly less than 1% of agricultural excess nutrients, during the period of 2015-2020. This low export of nitrogen in comparison to the nearby dryland (6% of the nitrogen inputs during the same period) leads to an important question on the factors controlling the low nitrogen export despite the intensity of the agricultural activities. To address this question, we carried out three field surveys, covering different flow events and collected surface and groundwater across 56 and 45 sites, respectively, in the irrigation district across three major land uses – dairy, horticulture and beef production. The variations of nitrogen species and nitrate isotopes (δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>18</sup>O) of the surface water suggested that up to 70% of nitrate input was denitrified before leaving the farms. Similarly, the generally low nitrate concentrations in the groundwater underlying the irrigated farms supported the prominent role of denitrification. It is postulated that residual fertiliser-derived nitrate was denitrified in the subsurface environment before discharging into receiving drains and streams. The nitrate isotope data has also enabled us to identify hot moments of denitrification and nitrification which varied following a heavy rainfall event (&gt;200mm in a day).

Results indicate a marked seasonality in APs and POC sedimentation, with the highest levels occurring in summer and fall associated with biological productivity. APs sedimentation ranged from 7.23 to 849.30 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, and POC sedimentation ranged from 30.28 to 1327.70 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. The POC and APs sedimentation are synchronized, while Saharan dust deposition and chlorophyll-a promote POC sedimentation with a four-week time lag. APs sedimentation is synchronized with cyanobacteria abundance, divalent cations with a two-week lag, and prokaryotic abundance with a four-week time lag. These findings highlight the importance of acidic polysaccharides in promoting carbon export to sediments and the complex interplay of biotic and chemical factors.",2,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Sala Menorca B,

Culturally meromictic lakes with permanently anoxic monimolimnia are an extreme response to such perturbations. Here we present results from water column and sediment core measurements at Brownie Lake (Minnesota, U.S.A.), which transitioned to meromixis due to basin disturbances in the 1910s, and enhanced stratification due to runoff of road deicing salts since the 1950s. Brownie Lake has some of the highest methane emissions reported for freshwaters with low C:N and depleted &amp;delta; &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C indicating an autochthonous source of particulate organic carbon. Iron is the dominant terminal electron acceptor in the monimolimnion due to the dearth of oxygen, sulfate, and nitrate resulting in ‘ferruginous’ conditions (i.e., abundant dissolved ferrous iron). A reaction-transport model based on data from the water and sediments shows a high efficiency of methanogenesis compared to other modes of organic carbon remineralization, indicating the importance of terminal electron acceptor availability in carbon dynamics of anoxic lakes. The average sediment organic carbon decreased after the onset of meromixis (from 26 wt% to 9 wt%). The average sediment iron increased (from 0.4 wt% to 2.60 wt%) after the onset of ferruginous conditions.

Yet, calcification likely takes place in the majority of the world’s lakes. CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation is linked to ecosystem primary production and occurs when nutrient-enriched surface waters stimulate intense CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation. Calcification sometimes results in spectacular whiting events, turning surface waters into a milky-blue colour, detectable with satellite imagery. The subsequent release of CO<sub>2 </sub>impacts metabolism rates, and competes with other feedback mechanisms, such as decreases in light availability and net losses of bioavailable phosphorus by adsorption and coprecipitation. These processes are complex, and there is a large need for field observations to quantitatively approach how they impact carbon budgets in lentic ecosystems. To shed light on these processes, we combined <em>in situ</em> data with remotely sensed multispectral reflectance obtained in Sau reservoir (North East Iberian Peninsula). <em>In situ</em> observations shed light on the temporal dynamics of pelagic CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation and satellite records indicated the occurrence of previously unreported whiting events.

Application to Mediterranean beaches,"Natural beaches erode and accrete in response to meteorological and oceanographic drivers, modulated by anthropic barriers which may be present on the beach or in the beach hinterland. These barriers reduce the natural resilience of coastal systems by decreasing sand availability and hindering the capacity of long- and cross- shore processes to partially self-adapt beaches to prevailing meteorological and oceanographic pressures, in particular to their evolution under climate change. Artificial adaptation by means of beach nourishment is normally governed by optimizing deployment costs and subject to limited understanding of the natural system. This results in beaches far from the target equilibrium conditions, impairing the effectiveness and longevity of nourishments.

A critical mechanism by which tidal wetlands accrete vertically, thereby maintaining elevation relative to sea level, is through accumulation of fluvial suspended sediment. However, many coastal areas are sediment limited, though the degree and extent of sediment limitations are poorly quantified. We estimated annual fluvial sediment delivery rates to tidal wetlands across the Contiguous US through a geospatial combination of water drainage networks, modeled suspended sediment loads, and wetland extents. Estimated sediment delivery rates were compared to relative sea level rise (RSLR) and to previously published vertical accretion rates, thereby establishing whether fluvial sediment is sufficient to prevent drowning and the degree to which systems may be acquiring elevation through other mechanisms (e.g., autochthons carbon accumulation, sediment importing from marine sources, storm driven sediment delivery). Most rivers across the US Northeast (72%), Southeast (89%), and Central and Western Gulf of Mexico (89 &amp; 52%, respectively) appear sediment limited, while 70% of Pacific rivers are sediment rich.

Additionally, anthropogenic activities, such as land use changes and nutrient pollution, can further lower the Ωarg in estuaries. However, acidification in eutrophic estuaries is not well understood. Here, we investigated Ωarg changes in three contrasting Korean estuary systems in summer; Han River (HR), an open estuary, and the Guem River (GR) and Youngsan River (YSR), closed estuaries where are enclosed by dam at the river mouth. Our findings showed that the mean Ωarg in HR, GR, and YSR estuaries are 1.6±0.7, 1.9±0.6, and 2.5±0.6, respectively. It is interesting that open estuary is lower than closed estuaries. During the summer, the river waters inputs delivered poorly buffered water to the upper estuaries, resulting in low Ωarg. However, seawater mixing toward Yellow Sea, with relatively higher, buffered the decrease in Ωarg at the lower estuaries. Our result suggest&nbsp;that river water inputs of low-to-intermediate total alkalinity can expand estuarine acidification zone, and the decrease in Ωarg is expected to accelerate over time in regions where the buffering capacity decrease.

Fish were inventoried before works and reconnection (in autumn 2019 and spring 2020) and after (seasonally in 2021) at two different stations: the East station drained by the Moulinette river whose bed was restored and the West station, restored and periodically reconnected to the sea to keep constant water levels in pounds. The changes in fish communities was studied through inter-comparison of taxonomic and functional structures using diversity indices. Results showed that works induced a shift in the fish assemblage composition with species replacement, without causing any erosion neither of its taxonomic or of its functional diversity. Contrarily, the reconnections to sea impacted both taxonomic and functional fish communities due to abiotic changes and immigration of estuarine and marine species.

Deforestation can create new channels with relatively high-velocity flows due to a significant reduction in drag forces. These flows can enhance removal of soil carbon from the channels. Paradoxically, the presence of these channels contribute to a reduction of flow velocities within the adjacent forest and potentially facilitate sedimentation. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments using a simplified model of mangrove roots, which were represented by random and emerged cylinder arrays that partially fill the flume in the lateral.

In the Arctic, the main contributors to stream productivity are microbial biofilms, which are composed of algae, bacteria and fungi embedded within a polysaccharide matrix. The aim of this study was to understand how environmental variables affect biofilm biomass in Greenland streams along a climate gradient. We studied biofilm chlorophyll <em>a</em> (chl <em>a</em>), a proxy for autotrophic biomass, and total biomass (ash-free dry weight) within and between three regions (subarctic, low Arctic, and high Arctic). Within each region, riparian vegetation coverage differed among the sites, meaning that the transport of nutrients from riparian soils to the streams is likely different. All samples were obtained during summer. Our predictions were the following: (1) chl <em>a</em> and total biomass levels will decrease along the climate gradient from subarctic to high Arctic and from densely vegetated to sparsely vegetated riparian areas; and (2) nutrient concentrations and air temperature will positively affect chl <em>a</em> and total biomass.

However, how these stressors together affect the pelagic food-web quality, in terms of polyunsaturated fatty-acid (PUFA) content, is unknown. We assessed the fatty-acid compositions of seston and zooplankton in 18 boreal and 15 subarctic lakes in Sweden across gradients in DIN:TP, DOC, and water temperature. Data show that the total contents of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) increased by 123–230% in seston, calanoids, and overall copepods across a lake molar DIN:TP gradient from 0.17 to 14.53, indicating their lower nutritional quality in the more N-limited lakes. Water temperature affected EPA+DHA contents of zooplankton, especially cladocerans, but not seston. For every 1℃ increase, cladoceran EPA+DHA contents were reduced by ca. 6%. EPA+DHA contents of <em>Bosmina</em>, cyclopoids, and copepods increased in the browner lakes. Our results indicate that zooplankton quality decreases with warming alone (for cladocerans) or in combination with declining lake DIN:TP (for copepods), but impacts of these stressors on zooplankton PUFA are moderated by lake browning.

Our analyses of NDVI and plot-scale vegetation cover shows that this can be attributed to the long-term greening of the catchments of these lakes and the concurrent sequestration of C, N and P in terrestrial vegetation. Despite this severe oligotrophication, no long-term changes were observed in the phytoplankton composition, likely due to low abundances and the large share of mixotrophs. We then sampled epilithic biofilms of 10 lakes and 10 streams along a latitudinal gradient (61–68°N) and analyzed the taxonomic composition of algae and meiofauna. These analyses showed relatively high abundances of cyanobacteria, suggesting that nitrogen fixing was common in these biofilms. Primary producer assemblages shifted from diatom- to cyanobacteria-predominated along a nutrient gradient, which affected concentrations of long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids and thus the food quality of the biofilms for invertebrate grazers. Lake biofilms were generally more developed than stream biofilms and had higher abundances of nematodes, copepods, and cladocerans. The relationships of algal and meiofaunal assemblages to environmental drivers will be discussed. The high abundances of meiofauna show that these biofilms are highly complex habitats and highlight that it is precarious to use bulk biofilms samples (scraped, brushed) as a proxy of basal resource in food web studies using stable isotopes.&nbsp;",3,441,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Alpha diversity was lowest at high latitudes and constrained primarily by temperature and spatial connectivity. Beta diversity showed high variability among ecoregions for most organism groups with a high degree of dissimilarity within many ecoregions illustrating the uniqueness of these communities. Northward range expansion of taxa into Arctic regions represents a pressure that may lead to large changes in freshwater ecosystem state, to increased competition for cold-stenothermic and cold-adapted species, and ultimately to the irreversible extinction of unique Arctic flora and fauna. Unfortunately, monitoring of biodiversity change in Arctic freshwaters is currently inadequate, making it difficult, if not impossible, to predict changes in ecosystem services.

Although climate induced oligotrophication is a widespread phenomenon in the north its effects on the aquatic food web are still largely unknown. To study the properties of these food webs and potential effects of the ongoing oligotrophication, we combined almost 40 years of time series data with a nutrient gradient study covering 16 lakes in the Arctic/alpine ecoregion of Sweden. We have data on carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition for consumers and primary producers from pelagic and benthic habitats which we combine with temporal water chemistry and biomass data. Total phosphorus concentrations decreased between 45 and 80 % in the five lakes with temporal data, a decrease of the same size as the simulated nutrient decrease created by the nutrient gradient. Overall, we observed few general effects of oligotrophication on the food webs, with similar stable isotope composition and biomasses among the studied lakes. Instead, we argue that other factors e.g., species composition and trophic interactions could affect the responses to oligotrophication. For example, the results of stable isotope analyses indicated a higher utilization of pelagic resources over time for Arctic charr in lakes with co-occurrence of Brown trout whereas this pattern was not found in the lake with only charr. In addition, the benthic macroinvertebrate population decreased drastically over time in two of the studied lakes, while staying relatively stable in others.&nbsp;",3,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Sala Menorca B,

Biological N fixation is the main pathway by which atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> enters the biosphere, thus this biogeochemical process influences N availability for biological activity in pristine ecosystems. In freshwaters, microbial biofilms are a hotspot for N cycling, but there is limited information on their role in fixing N<sub>2</sub>. We explored potential N fixation across 25 small Arctic streams in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Svalbard by characterizing the microbial community and quantifying the abundance of the gene involved in biological N fixation (nifH). We determined the main environmental drivers, both on a habitat scale (i.e., water and sediment characteristics) and at the catchment scale (i.e. vegetation and geology). Sampled streams displayed high variability in both N concentrations and biofilms; dissolved inorganic N ranged from 10 to 337 µg N L<sup>-1</sup>, microbial abundance ranged from 9.95×10<sup>5</sup> to 3.09 ×10<sup>9 </sup>16S rRNA gene copies g<sup>-1</sup> sediment dry weight and nifH genes ranged from 3.86×10<sup>4</sup> to 3.65 ×10<sup>8 </sup>gene copies g<sup>-1 </sup>sediment dry weight. We found that stream N limitation (measured as ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolve inorganic nitrogen) and dissolved iron concentrations were positively related to nifH gene abundance in stream sediments.

Increasing permafrost thaw can release considerable amounts of carbon into Arctic freshwaters, leading to increased DOC levels, brownification and associated shifts towards more microbially driven aquatic food webs. However, how the permafrost carbon affects higher trophic levels remains poorly understood. We investigated the influence of large DOC gradients on fatty acid composition of primary producers, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and fish in Arctic and subarctic lakes in the circumpolar north. Our database is composed of fatty acid data from over 200 Arctic lakes compiled from international collaboration efforts. Our results suggest that increases in DOC can stimulate primary producers, likely due to the parallel increase in nutrients of terrestrial origin (total phosphorus and nitrogen). The stimulus of primary producers, however, is not well reflected higher into the aquatic food web. Both zooplankton and fish maintained higher levels of omega3 fatty acids in low DOC systems. This suggest that permafrost thaw has potential to deteriorate the nutritious quality of Arctic freshwater food webs, which can have further consequences for polar ecosystems and the northern and indigenous communities heavily relying on local fish as a food source.",4,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Sala Menorca B,

Such changes in lake environmental conditions can have profound impacts on the synthesis and trophic transfer of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which are necessary for consumer growth and reproduction. Zooplankton grazers are major trophic links between phytoplankton and fish, but how zooplankton fatty acids (FA) respond to multiple climate-related stressors is not well understood.

Zooplankton FA responses across the lake gradients also differed among taxa: cladoceran genera such as <em>Bosmina</em> and <em>Daphnia</em> showed declines in PUFA and eicosapentaenoic acid levels in warmer, browner, and more eutrophic lakes; while diaptomid copepod grazers had high and relatively stable PUFA levels. Also, all zooplankton taxa increased in stearidonic acid levels in larger lakes where cryptophytes were more abundant.

We explore how climate change may affect these food webs by examining patterns of macroinvertebrate biological traits along contemporary latitudinal and climatic gradients. We assessed trait composition across a large extent of the Arctic in eastern North America (Canada) and northwestern Europe (Sweden, Norway). Despite differences in taxonomic composition between continents, we identified similarities in the functional trait niche (FTN) of dominant macroinvertebrate taxonomic groups. Trait composition differed by latitude in eastern Canada, with a predominance of cold-tolerant taxa, tubular body shape, and cased and attached habits at the highest latitudes. Differences in trait composition were evident among boreal, alpine, and Arctic ecoregions in European streams, with similar patterns in trait dominance at the highest latitudes. When data from both continents were combined, we found an increase in the relative abundance of cold tolerance and tubular body shape and a decrease in obligate shredders and trait richness with decreasing temperatures. These patterns are indicative of FTNs that include physiological traits and habits that are advantageous for the cold temperatures, short ice-free period, and low riparian cover at the highest latitudes.

However, the vast majority of this research has focused on pelagic algae using one-dimensional (1D) models. Modelling work on benthic algae has been much more limited. Also, 1D models severely constrain benthic algae since they are constricted to a single depth at the bottom of the 1D water column. We developed a 2D model to study resource competition between benthic and pelagic algae in 2D vs 1D, and the effect of horizontal mixing on this interaction in lakes of different size, depth and water clarity. The model consists of coupled reaction-diffusion partial differential equations including sedimentation and nutrient recycling in the sediment. Algal growth is assumed to be limited by light and a single nutrient. The model exhibits several novel phenomena only possible in higher dimensions and the magnitude of horizontal mixing can strongly affect pelagic-benthic algal competition. Under most conditions, benthic algae are much more resilient in 2D compared to 1D. For example, at sufficiently high vertical mixing, we observe a shift from dominance of pelagic to dominance of benthic algae, which becomes more strongly expressed the lower the background water clarity. The underlying mechanisms involve (1) increased horizontal mixing of nutrients towards shallow areas where benthic algae reside, and (2) increased horizontal transport of pelagic algae towards deeper waters where they get mixed down to light-limited depths.",3,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Palma,

Unchelated iron Fe(III)´ is a good proxy for Fe availability to model eukaryotic species in artificial seawater. However, it was generally believed that the concentration of Fe(III)’ in vast surface oceans is too low to be important for phytoplankton nutrition. Using a recently developed approach based on the intrinsic acid-base properties of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) that accounts for its heterogeneity, we combine datasets of global in situ seawater chemistry including pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved Fe and dissolved organic carbon, to estimate the Fe(III)´ concentration in surface oceans. The DOM heterogeneity results in an 8 orders of magnitude range of Fe(III)´. We find the cellular Fe quota of natural eukaryotic phytoplankton from major ocean regions can be predicted by ambient seawater Fe(III)´, except under strongly Fe limiting conditions. Based upon our estimated Fe(III)´ concentration in surface oceans and laboratory observed growth response of 29 diatom species to Fe(III)´, the predicted Fe limitation is highly consistent with globally in situ nutrient addition bioassays and generally agrees with the relative abundance and expression of genes associated with Fe starvation–induced proteins in diatoms from the Tara Oceans dataset. This study highlights the importance of accounting the heterogeneity of marine DOM binding sites when determining Fe(III)´ and resolves inconsistencies in our understanding of Fe speciation and bioavailability, which will in turn improve predictions in marine primary productivity and biological carbon fixation.",3,,6/7/23 10:30,6/7/23 12:00,Sala Palma,

Furthermore, ecological thresholds resulting in environmental shifts in ecosystem conditions remain poorly constrained, together with recovery triggers and mechanisms linked to non-linear environmental factors. Here, we reconstructed microalgae communities, organic matter sources, and environmental conditions based on the study of dated sediment cores within a semi-closed embayment in Western Australia that experienced severe shifts in ecological condition from a relatively natural state to a eutrophic state over the past century, and recently to a recovery state. Change point modeling results demonstrated a lag-phase or resilience period since the onset of settlements and agriculture in the 1900s, and shifts in ecosystem condition from the 1950s linked to industrial expansion that enhanced organic carbon, nitrogen fluxes, microalgae biomarkers (dinosterol, brassicasterol, and C<sub>37</sub> alkenone)， and sedimentary diatoms. Although the data from the core in the shallow area indicated a later point of change in microalgae community structure, which was likely explained by coastal engineering design. Diatoms have been winning over Dinoflagellates in recent decades as nutrients have been reduced, but the presence of <em>Dictyota octonaria</em> made us unsure if water quality has been truly improved. Additionally, both the data in the sediment cores and the water column reflected that microalgae biomass was not sensitive to decreases in nutrients and remained high which may be the result of a series of non-linear factors such as the changed microalgae community and increased sea surface temperature (SST).

Despite its importance, there is minimal <em>in situ</em> data detailing how changing light availability affects production in seagrass meadows and on microphytobenthos dominated sandflats. To rectify this, in a seagrass meadow (<em>Zostera muelleri</em>) and an adjacent sandflat habitat we derived <em>in situ</em> seasonal photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves for two years during submerged and emerged periods. P-I curves demonstrated strong light responses in both habitats during submergence, but during emergence in the unvegetated sandflat there was little relationship between light availability and photosynthesis. Seagrass habitats were also more productive than the unvegetated sandflat during both tidal states and both habitats showed reduced production during emergence. Integrating our seasonally derived P-I curves during submerged and emerged conditions into a conceptual model suggests that increasing submergence time could increase annual gross primary production in both habitats provided the water column remained clear. However, reductions in water clarity will decrease submerged primary production increasing the reliance on emerged production which will be diminished with sea-level rise.

The ecological processes that drive the uptake of nutrients and responses to increased turbidity are inherently non-linear, and so minor changes to loading can drive rapid and unpredictable changes in ecosystem dynamics. Here we explore one of the processes that mediates benthic productivity in a key intertidal species, the deposit-feeding bivalve, <em>Macomona lilliana</em>, using a simple non-linear model. <em>M.</em> <em>lilliana </em>feed on microphytobenthos (MPB) at the sediment surface, and through the exhalent siphon excrete nutrients into porewaters at depth.

We modelled this system where MPB are controlled by the activities of <em>M. lilliana</em> (i.e. grazing rates and pumping capacity which supplies limited nutrients) and light (controlled by water column turbidity) using published field and lab measurements. Pressurisation caused by the pumping activity is superimposed on a background pressure generated by the tide and waves, which are used to generate upward flow using Darcy’s law. The model shows that slow variations in forcing parameters like light can cause a rapid biomass response, associated with a shift between a MPB-dominated system to a <em>M.

As the nitrogen fixation requires a high amount of energy, and since the concentration of inorganic phosphorus is subject to fluctuations in the ocean, P&nbsp;may be a limiting inorganic nutrient for this process. Here, we investigated how phosphorus limitation affected the model single-celled diazotrophic cyanobacterial species, <em>Crocosphaera subtropica (</em>formerly<em> Cyanothece</em>) ATCC 51142. We evaluated growth, nitrogen&nbsp;and carbon&nbsp;fixation, photosynthetic efficiency and quantified the energy cost of carbon&nbsp;and nitrogen&nbsp;metabolisms, under P- limited and replete conditions. Overall, growth rates, nitrogen&nbsp;and carbon&nbsp;fixation of <em>C. subtropica</em> decreased under P-limitation. Interestingly, nitrogen&nbsp;fixation showed a shift towards the latest hours of the dark period compared to the early peak displayed by the P- replete culture. Moreover, P usage efficiency for nitrogen&nbsp;and carbon&nbsp;fixation were, respectively, three- and two-times lower in the P- limited than in the replete condition. Despite the reduction in growth rates and nitrogen&nbsp;and carbon&nbsp;fixation, our data suggest that <em>C. subtropica </em>is still able to grow under P- limiting condition.

TEP and aggregation were also shown to be enhanced under nutrient limited growth conditions. In this study we carried out experiments to test whether other small phytoplankton species exude TEP and form microaggregates, and if these are enhanced under growth-limiting conditions. The picocyanobacterium <em>Prochlorococcus marinus</em> (0.8 µm), the nanodiatom <em>Minutocellus polymorphus </em>(4 µm), and the picoprasinophyte <em>Ostreococcus lucimarinus </em>(0.6 µm) were grown in axenic batch culture experiments under nutrient replete and limited conditions. We found that nutrient limitation increased TEP concentration in all three species, and formation of microaggregates was significantly enhanced in <em>Minutocellus</em> and <em>Ostreococcus</em> in distinct size ranges. Surprisingly, <em>Ostreococcus, </em>the smallest eukaryote known, produced more TEP than <em>Prochlorococcus</em> and <em>Minutocellus </em>per unit cell volume.

However, emissions can vary greatly with high levels of within-lake spatial heterogeneity and distinct zones of open water and littoral habitats. Macrophytes play an important role in the function of these ecosystems by increasing habitat complexity and water clarity. Lake Wingra is a eutrophic, shallow lake that is fed by urban stormwater runoff and groundwater in Madison, Wisconsin (USA). We measured surface dissolved concentrations of CH4 and CO2 at eight sites during the open water and ice-covered season, and diffusive flux of CH4 and CO2 during open water. Gas efflux varied both temporally and spatially. The rates of diffusive flux for CH4 were higher in the summer (2.4 to 10 mmol m-2 d-1) than the fall (0.88 to 2.5 mmol m-2 d-1), whereas rates of&nbsp; CO2 &nbsp;where higher in the fall (-20 to -6.3 mmol m-2 d-1) than the summer (-53 to -0.13 mmol m-2 d-1), with the exception of one site dominated by periphyton. Across seasons, the lake was a sink for CO2 with the highest uptake in areas with the densest patches of submerged macrophytes compared to sites dominated by floating macrophytes. In comparison, CH4 was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen at the sediment-water interface.

Currently, the AMOC is in a state of strong overturning, but studies have shown that climate change might tip the AMOC to a state of weak overturning. Changing the state of the AMOC affects the global climate, and especially the climate in the North Atlantic. Due to disrupted meridional heat transport, the Northern Hemisphere is expected to cool while the Southern Hemisphere is expected to warm. Besides effects on the climate, the AMOC also influences the carbon cycle by transporting nutrients and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon. Deep water formation in the North Atlantic is, for example, an important pathway of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean. It can therefore be expected that a weakening of the AMOC affects the marine carbon cycle and therefore also atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub>. Here, we investigate the effect of a forced AMOC weakening on the marine carbon cycle and atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;using simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model v2 (CESM2). We force the simulations with the emission driven SSP5-8.5 scenario and additionally, force the simulations with an additional freshwater flux in the North Atlantic Ocean. This so-called hosing weakens the AMOC on top of a weakening caused by the greenhouse gas emissions. We use these simulations to determine how much and through what mechanisms, an AMOC weakening affects the air-sea gas exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> and primary production in the ocean.",1,,6/7/23 10:30,6/7/23 12:00,Sala Palma,

While recent studies refined the magnitude and biogeochemical conditions underlying calcite precipitation at fine scales, the mechanisms supporting the nucleation of calcite are poorly described. In the pelagic realm of deep oligotrophic lakes, calcite nucleation has often been associated with autotrophic picoplankton, however, direct observations remain scarce. Here, we focused on the largest hardwater lake of western Europe, Lake Geneva, and combined depth-resolved high-frequency with discrete sample data to investigate the coupled dynamics of calcite precipitation and picoplankton populations. Calcite precipitation during periods of lake thermal stratification and high productivity coincided with peaks in the abundance of distinct picoplankton populations that were characterized based on specific spectral fluorescence signatures using flow cytometry. The vertical distribution of the dominant picocyanobacteria population over time evidenced maximum abundances at depths of enhanced water column stability and alkalinity depletion. Moreover, sorting of this phycoerythrin rich population combined with imaging by SEM-EDX enabled analyzing diverse patterns of association between calcite crystals and picoplankton cells.

Although reservoir’s water quality is monitored since the begging of 2000s, little is known about how hydro-thermodynamics influence transport of substances and set conditions for the growth of primary producers. Objectives This work aims to contribute to a better management of the water quality in Rincón del Bonete reservoir by developing numerical tools that helps to understand the system dynamics and predict its future behaviour. A particular interest is to explore the conditions that explained the absence of blooms in a recent summer (2020-2021). Methods A numerical model was calibrated and validated based on a combination of continuous measurements, remote sensing estimations, and historical periodic monitoring data. Delft3D-FLOW was used to characterize hydrodynamics, thermal structure, and vertical mixing in the reservoir, while Delft3D-ECO was used to represent water quality and primary production using FLOW results as an input. Results and conclusions The model can simulate spatial and temporal variability of hydrodynamics, temperature, nutrients, sediments, dissolved oxygen, and phytoplankton. It contributed to the identification and quantification of the processes that determine the phytoplankton dynamics in the reservoir.

The released nutrients (mostly N and P) can trigger phytoplankton growth. Despite being a well-known problem, up to now, internal loading has not been determined at high-temporal resolution due to methods constraints and the immense efforts associated with the data acquisition. The new generation of in-situ wet chemistry analyzers now enables us to measure benthic nutrient pulses at high temporal resolution. We deployed in-situ wet chemistry SRP analyzer, multi-parameter probes (including ammonium), and an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) for long periods in a shallow polymictic lake from April to October. This enabled us to gain more insights into high temporal resolution in-situ P dynamics. We hypothesize that P release in shallow polymictic lakes occurs in pulsed regimes. Our results show that indeed P release occurs in pulsed regimes and is coupled to ammonium release under anoxic conditions; multiple concentration peaks of up to 0.5 and 0.7 mg L<sup>-1</sup> were observed for SRP and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N respectively. We also observed SRP peaks under oxic conditions which suggest that there are other sources of SRP mobilization.

We coupled these high-frequency datasets with monthly water and sediment sampling for dissolved nutrients, chlorophyll a, and ash-free dry mass. Difficulty in constraining metabolism estimates at 10 and 15 meters water depth suggest that the dissolved oxygen signal was most strongly affected by physical mixing.

However, phytoplankton growth is Fe-limited in nearly 40% of the euphotic areas of the global ocean. Importantly, the changing surface ocean pH may considerably alter Fe bioavailability and may have consequences on phytoplankton growth. Diatoms are key eukaryotic photosynthetic algae that contribute to one-fifth of the global and 40% of the marine primary production and often show high efficiency for Fe uptake. Under Fe limitation, marine diatoms possess several mechanisms to upregulate the Fe uptake using a “high-affinity Fe transport system”. The copper (Cu) containing enzymes Multicopper Oxidase (MCOs), belonging to a multi-protein family, is part of this high-affinity Fe transport system. In experimental studies, MCO encoding genes were found to be abundant and expressed in Fe-starved marine diatoms indicating its potential as a tool to assess Fe stress in natural populations of marine diatoms. However, similar studies from the global oceans are rare. The present study analyzed the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data of MCOs in natural populations of marine diatoms (covering four size fractions: 0.8–5 µm, 5–20 µm, 20–180 µm, and 180–2,000 µm) using the Marine Atlas of <em>Tara </em>Oceans Unigenes (MATOU.v2) relating different environmental parameters.

However, several reports suggest that CH<sub>4</sub> can also be produced in the oxic water column, known as oxic methane production (OMP).

Regardless of the mechanism involved, the contribution of OMP to total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from lakes remains unclear. In this study, we explored OMP and its contribution to total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in shallow lakes of the Pampean Plain that present different abundance and composition of microalgae. We carried out field experiments in three shallow lakes, where we deployed 4 mesocosms (M) per lake.

Preliminary results indicate that the three lakes had OMP, but with differing rates and contribution to total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, ranging from 9.4% to 46.5%.

Members of the bacterial order Methylococcales, which contains well-known aerobic methanotrophs, have been increasingly observed in anoxic waters including oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), suggesting a contribution to methane oxidation. However, the metabolism that sustains them in the absence of oxygen is unknown. We investigated the metabolic pathways of methanotrophs in the coastal OMZ of Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica, using experimental incubations and metagenomics. Methane oxidation rates from incubations indicated an efficient methanotrophic community conducting anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification. Rates in the anoxic OMZ were up to 55% inhibited by the presence of 0.2 µM oxygen. Metagenomic analysis identified three Methylococcales ecotypes as the only methanotrophs in the OMZ, two belonging to the OPU3 clade and one clustering with <em>Methylomarinum vadi</em>, displaying an apparent redox-driven niche partitioning. All ecotypes had the genetic inventory for aerobic methane oxidation, but we found no evidence of an oxygen source in the OMZ, suggesting the existence of an elusive anaerobic metabolism. Nitrate-respiration genes were present in all ecotypes, but only one of the OPU3 ecotypes encoded an alternative NO reductase, genetically linking methane oxidation and denitrification to N<sub>2</sub>O. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that differences in nitrogen respiration ability contribute to the observed niche partitioning between ecotypes, but the precise metabolism remains to be discovered.",0,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Auditorium Mallorca,Invited

However, rapid environmental change throughout these ecosystems will likely lead to higher lake water temperatures, prolongation of the ice-free season, and increasing input of organic matter from permafrost soils and glaciers to the lakes. Understanding key controls on CH<sub>4</sub> sources and sinks is important to anticipate potential feedback effects between high-arctic and alpine lakes and the climate system. Comprehensive insights into microbial CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation will be critical, but there is little knowledge on how the microbial methane filter functions in high-arctic and -alpine lakes and how it will react to climate change. To address this issue, we investigated&nbsp;methane dynamics in two oligotrophic high arctic glacial lakes in Spitsbergen with contrasting biogeochemistry. The water column and sediments of both lakes, as well as major inflows and outflows were sampled in September 2022 and our preliminary results show that the sediments of Lake Myrktjorna exhibit a clear biogenic CH<sub>4</sub> source. In Lake Revvatnet on the contrary, the CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations are low throughout the sediment and water column profile. Ongoing measurements of major ion concentrations, molecular genetic and lipid-biomarker analyses in the water column and sediments of the two lakes will allow us to identify potential sources and sinks of CH<sub>4</sub>, and will outline a perspective towards understanding CH<sub>4</sub> dynamics in response to changing/variable environmental conditions in high arctic and high alpine lakes.",0,453,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Reservoir flushing is a strategy that is used to erode and flush out excessive sediment through the dam outlet, by using strong water currents that are generated during water level drawdown. Consequently, the CH<sub>4 </sub>that was stored in the porewater of the sediment can potentially mobilize into the water and eventually degas to the atmosphere. Here, we investigate these CH<sub>4 </sub>emissions based on a flushing scenario in Schwarzenbach reservoir (Germany). We measured seasonal changes in CH<sub>4 </sub>concentrations in the sediment of the reservoir and estimated potential CH<sub>4</sub> emissions due to reservoir flushing. Furthermore, we assessed the relative contribution of this pathway in comparison to typical CH<sub>4 </sub>emissions via other pathways in Schwarzenbach reservoir. Our data suggest that the timing of reservoir flushing might affect the amount of potentially emitted CH<sub>4</sub>, as CH<sub>4 </sub>concentrations in the sediment differ considerably in the upper sediment layers throughout the season. While the estimated CH<sub>4 </sub>emissions due to reservoir flushing represent a large fraction of the total annual CH<sub>4 </sub>emissions in Schwarzenbach reservoir, this pathway is relatively insignificant due to the reservoirs low flushing frequency. However, in reservoirs that are flushed frequently, the CH<sub>4 </sub>emissions related to flushing operations might be substantial and should be considered in their greenhouse gas budget.",4,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

Metalimnetic methane accumulation has been concomitantly attributed to advective fluxes transporting CH<sub>4</sub> from methanogenic littoral sediments to the lake center, and&nbsp;to autochthonous oxic production through different microbial metabolisms including the phosphonate-pathway by Cyanobacteria. We aimed to address the origin of the metalimnetic methane accumulation with an extensive sampling campaign across Lake Geneva in the summer of 2022. Methane advective transport was tracked using CH<sub>4</sub> δ<sup>13</sup>C (delta13C) while the potential for microbial methane production was assessed through molecular analysis. Surprisingly, dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> in Lake Geneva was negatively&nbsp;correlated with blue-green algae (to be further confirmed by the targeted amplicon sequencing). Instead, CH<sub>4</sub> was closely associated with turbidity suggesting that the methane is transported by the interflow of the Rhône river across tens of km during the stratification period which was also confirmed in the isotopic analysis. We used a simple advection-reaction model to test the possibility of this hypothesis. In summary, our results suggest that the metalimnetic methane peak in Lake Geneva is likely to result from the advection of CH<sub>4</sub> produced in sediments and remobilized by turbulences at the river inflow.",1,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

Stratified water bodies may store methane in the hypolimnion, while deeper sites may provide more opportunity for CH<sub>4</sub> consumption as it is mixed through oxygenated water. Climate driven variability in temperature and precipitation can dramatically impact interannual changes in water depth in small reservoirs, therefore we predicted that deeper, more strongly stratified systems will emit less methane summer months, compared to shallower sites. In this seasonal study of 20 reservoirs, we assessed the impacts of interannual variability in winter/spring (January to April) snow fall and precipitation in 2021 (24.8 mm) and in 2022 (34.9 mm), on open water depths (Z<sub>2021</sub>= 1.17 ± 1.03 m and Z<sub>2022</sub>= 2.32 ± 1.00 m). Initial findings determined that surface dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> was higher in 2021 (3.78 ± 9.61 µM) than in 2022 (2.62 ± 1.00 µM) (p &lt; 0.05), while hypolimnetic dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> was similar between years (2021: 18.41 ± 52.31 µM; 2022: 39.33 ± 113.98 µM). Generalized Additive Models suggested that reduced CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations in surface waters were attributed to increased depths and stronger stratification. These findings suggest that maintaining deeper water and stronger stratification in wet regimes increases the storage capacity of dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> in the hypolimnion and offer longer pathways for dissolved gases to be recycled in the water column.&nbsp;",4,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

Aquatic ecosystems&nbsp;are important natural sources of methane emissions to the atmosphere. The production, oxidation, and emission of methane by these ecosystems are governed by a complex interplay between physical and biological processes. While the physical matrix (e.g. water column stratification) frames the conditions for biological processes to happen, recent evidence suggests that a variety of metabolic strategies enable methane production and oxidation under previously unexpected conditions. Similarly, physical conditions control the extent of methane production, oxidation, and emission in aquatic ecosystems through, for instance, the duration of hypolimnetic anoxia and water column turnover, and the contribution of ebullition and degassing emission pathways. In this overview talk, we will discuss some of the recent advances in our understanding of the methane cycle in aquatic ecosystems and introduce the talks that we will have in this special session. We will also discuss current challenges and perspectives for future research in this field.

While their current global CH4 footprint has been estimated to about 2 Tmoles&nbsp;&nbsp;yr<sup>-1</sup>, little is known as to how CH4 emissions will be altered in the future in the face of climate change. To explore this question, we have a developed a GHG process-based model for reservoirs and applied it to a 1-D lake physical model (Simstrat v.3) forced from 10 climate models from CMIP6 for two climate scenarios (ssp245 and ssp585) over the next century. The same model structure was applied to a boreal (Eastmain-1) and a tropical (Petit-Saut) reservoir. Our results show a greater sensitivity to climate change in the boreal reservoir, with significant increase in epilimnetic temperatures accompanied by a lengthening of the stratification period by several weeks. No significant trend in thermocline depth was observed.

Yet, freshwater emission estimates are the most uncertain in the global carbon budget, in part, due to the important yet understudied effect of vegetation. Freshwaters may be dominated by submersed macrophytes, yet it is unclear how these populations affect GHGs. Here, we studied the effects of submersed macrophyte population density on GHG dynamics. We conducted a 60-day mesocosm (60 cm height&nbsp; x 20 cm diameter; 10 cm of sediment and 40 cm of water) experiment testing the following <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em> densities: 0, 10, 20, or 30 shoots (n = 3). Weekly, we measured diffusive CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes with a portable GHG analyzer and porewater and surface water concentrations using headspace equilibration and monitored pH, dissolved O<sub>2</sub>, and plant coverage of the water column. We measured the change in plant biomass and final sediment organic matter using loss on ignition methods. The highest density of <em>C. demersum</em> resulted in the highest CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2 </sub>surface water concentrations and emissions while there were no differences in the low and medium densities and no plant control. The highest <em>C. demersum</em> density had lower dissolved O<sub>2</sub> and lost biomass over the 60 days, indicating die-off and the addition of organic matter to the sediment. Our study shows that dense macrophyte stands stimulate GHG production and emissions through reduced O<sub>2</sub> and increased organic matter loads. The seasonality of macrophyte populations likely contribute to seasonal variability in GHG emissions in waterbodies.",3,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

Methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) in the water column can form a methane filter in the methane oxygen counter-gradient during summer stratification. This filter counteracts high benthic methane fluxes and decreases methane emissions. Recent studies have shown that the metabolism of the putative aerobic methanotrophs building this filter is more versatile and adapted to oxygen limitation than previously assumed. To investigate the seasonal dynamics of the methane filter, we monitored the water column chemistry, methanotrophic community structure, methane oxidation potential, and methane fluxes of marine Lake Grevelingen during nine sampling campaigns in 2021. The methane filter mainly consisted of three MOB belonging to <em>Methylomonadaceae</em>. The community composition, varied over depth and season, and is potentially driven by oxygen availability. Intriguingly, methane and oxygen gradients were spatially decoupled in late summer, and the relative abundance of MOB and potential methane oxidation was highest in the anoxic water. Potential methane oxidation was highest during summer stratification but decreased significantly in late summer. This was also reflected in lower water-air fluxes of methane at the start of stratification and higher fluxes in late summer. Hence, although the MOB community in the methane filter is quite resilient to changes in water chemistry, the seasonal water column dynamics influence the efficiency of methane removal.",5,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Auditorium Mallorca,Invited

However the contribution of oxic methane production (OMP) to CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from lakes, its temporal dynamic and main drivers are still unknown. In this study, we quantify the net production rate (P<sub>net</sub>), which is defined as the balance between OMP (adds CH<sub>4</sub>) and CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation (MOx, removes CH<sub>4</sub>) in the lake surface mixed layer on five Swiss lakes. Using an extensive dataset across trophic state gradients, we studied the P<sub>net</sub> occurrence, its contribution to diffusive CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, and the seasonal and diurnal variations using three mass balance approaches. Including literature data from additional lakes, light climate, Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll-a concentrations were identified as the main drivers of P<sub>net</sub>, suggesting that photoautotrophs play an important role in CH<sub>4</sub> production in surface oxic waters. Finally, using these datasets, an empirical up-scaling method is proposed to estimate P<sub>net</sub> rates in different lake ecosystems. This work highlights that while OMP is prevalent in most lakes studied, the extent of OMP, drivers and temporal dynamics need better understanding, especially considering the potential positive feedback between climate change, phytoplankton production and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions to the atmosphere.",2,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

At the sulfate-methane transition, the archaeal community is concurrently responsible for the oxidation of ascending methane and for the highest rates of methane production in the sediment column. While acetate is generally the most important terminal product of fermentation, acetoclastic methanogenesis is an indirect process that involves a syntrophic electron transfer from acetate-oxidizing bacteria to CO<sub>2</sub>-reducing archaea. Interestingly, this interspecies electron transfer was found to involve conductive minerals in experiments with sediment amended with activated carbon. We studied the zonation of sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation in Baltic Sea sediments and extracted and amplified DNA to characterize the microbial communities based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Specifically, we extracted ferromagnetic minerals with (semi)conductive properties for detailed sequence analyses. We found that archaea, potentially responsible for anaerobic oxidation of methane (ANME), and sulfate reducing bacteria, potentially responsible for syntrophic electron transfer (Seep-SRB), were selectively enriched on ferromagnetic minerals. A third of all identified amplicon sequence variants was exclusively found on ferromagnetic minerals.

The size of these bubbles is of crucial importance for bubble dissolution, gas exchange with the surrounding water, and ultimately for the gas flux into the atmosphere. However, little is known about the size of bubbles in natural ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we tested an innovative method to determine a representative bubble size from bubble oxygen content using an existing single bubble dissolution model. We compared bubble sizes estimated for different sites in eutrophic fish ponds and assessed the diurnal variability of bubble sizes. Bubbles were larger at the fish feeding sites, which represent ebullition (bubble flux) hotspots, compared to bubbles collected in the open water area. Bubble sizes measured directly by an optical bubble sensor, in contrast, were relatively similar at all sites. Careful re-analysis of bubble sensor data in combination with additional laboratory tests revealed that the sensor may miss very small as well as large bubbles – especially under the turbid water conditions in the ponds. We found a significant correlation between the ebullition rate and the model-derived bubble size. Our results showed that the bubble size differed substantially even within a small pond. Modelled bubble size was sensitive to the dissolved oxygen concentration. Calculating bubble size from oxygen content of collected bubbles provided a simple method to obtain information on a representative bubble size in shallow surface waters.",2,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Auditorium Mallorca,

Due to the immense areal coverage, ARP nutrients are believed to influence a considerable part of the Western Tropical North Atlantic. We studied the ARP during M174 in April 2021 from the equator to 14° N and 46 to 58° W. Scanfish transects and La Grangian drifter experiments with multiple casts of microstructure and other sensors revealed a stable stratification near the river mouth that was not disrupted by tidal currents. Four scanfish transects normal to the coast and one alongshore revealed strong plume influences in surface waters down to ca. 20m with elevated temperature and oxygen concentrations. We identified four water masses that were characterized by distinct nutrient levels. Nitrate concentrations generally declined with distance from the mouth and were at detection limit in surface waters at 14˚ N. In contrast, phosphate concentrations were low but detectable after a rapid decline in the vicinity of the river mouth. Overall, consumption rather than mixing with oligotrophic waters seems to be the main driver of nutrient concentrations. The high sediment load unveiled by the strong turbidity signal in our data is an indicator of the ARP that can still be detected in the entire water column off French Guyana. The seabed mainly acts as a reactor that converts the deposited organic matter into inorganic nitrogen (DIN).

Due to their operational definition, humic substances are characterized by a huge physical and chemical heterogeneity that should show in the nature of their interaction with iron. However, this binding heterogeneity was not detected by prior uses of competing ligand equilibrium techniques with electrochemical detection, the usual choice to study trace element speciation at natural low concentrations. In this work, we take advantage of the analytical electrolability of iron-humic complexes in order to carry out iron ligand exchange experiments where iron sequestration was forced by the addition of desferrioxamine B. The study of the kinetics of ligand competition and species partition at equilibrium revealed the truly heterogeneity of iron binding by reference humic substances. We also offer evidence against some assumptions in the field of iron speciation such as the weak overall affinity for iron of humic substances if compared to desferrioxamine B, and the reversibility of all iron ligand exchange reactions.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and composition of pellets on oceanic and sheltered sandy beaches and the potential effect of fluvial contribution on the occurrence of these MP on the coast of Bahia, Brazil. We also evaluated the concentrations of trace metals, including rare earth elements (REE), in pellets of different colors (white/ transparent, yellow, brown, and black) collected on sand beaches. Our study is one of the first reports of REE and trace elements in pellets. We found that the presence/absence of rivers influences the distribution of pellets.

Waters pass through a range of shallow passages, over continental shelves, and through multiple biogeochemical regimes, providing potential for transport, addition, and/or modification of elements. However, trace element and isotope data remain scarce from the region. We present a zonal surface transect of the Florida Current between the Bahamas and Florida sampled in Spring 2019. We sampled filtered surface waters using a towfish at ~2 mile resolution. The oligotrophic transect was characterized by two statistically-distinct water masses entering the Caribbean; in the east, higher salinity (36.5-36.9) water corresponds to salty, tropical North Atlantic waters entering the system via the Windward Passage, while in the west lower salinity (36.3-36.4) water corresponds to fresher tropical South Atlantic waters entering the system via more southerly passages (Schmidt &amp; Richardson, 1991). Similar dissolved Fe concentrations (0.5 nM) were observed across the transect with heavy Fe isotopes in the east consistent with a ligand-bound dust-derived Fe source and/or an origin in the tropical Atlantic, while Fe isotopes near Florida indicated sediment-derived Fe.

For this reason, in addition to the pollution problems derived from metal spills or other organic compounds such as hydrocarbons, organochlorines or pesticides, they can suffer eutrophication events. These processes occur mainly in coastal areas, with limited water exchanges with the ocean and low renewal rates. When a series of nutrients such as phosphate, nitrate and silicate accumulate, normally supplied in excess by different human activities, phytoplanktonic blooms occur and lead to darkening and anoxia in the deep layers of these systems, which ends up completely deteriorating them. It is well known that iron represents an important micronutrient for marine phytoplankton, being limiting in many areas of the ocean due to its low bioavailability. That is why a study has been carried out in the coastal lagoon of the Mar Menor (SE Spain), which has seen its waters undergo numerous eutrophication events in recent years with the aim of verifying the role of bioavailable Fe in the lagoon in these repeated events. To this end, the lagoon has been sampled eight times over a two-years period under different environmental conditions (eutrophication, sediment resuspension, strong rains and stationary periods). Ten sampling stations of the lagoon have been monitored. In addition to the levels of chlorophyll, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and nutrients, the total dissolved and particulate Fe and the organic speciation of this element have been analysed observing a great variability among stations and periods.",3,456,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, it is not yet fully understood what drives spatial and temporal variability of methane fluxes in these systems. Methane can be removed via oxidation by aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria (so-called methanotrophs), which have &nbsp;been suggested to oxidize up to half of all methane in coastal systems. It is therefore likely that changes in the abundance and activity of aerobic methanotrophs will influence methane emissions. Here we used geochemical and molecular tools to test the effects of low and &nbsp;high abundance of benthic meio- and macrofauna on methane fluxes. We found that both meio- and macrofauna in coastal sediments decrease methane oxidation rates, the relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs, and transcription of methane oxidizing genes. A decrease in fauna also increased the retention of methane in the sediment, while macrofauna was found to significantly increase the sediment–water methane flux (on average six times higher). These findings indicate that a large part of methane emissions from shallow marine waters is due to faunal activity, such as bioturbation and bioirrigation which accelerates methane flux, and potentially displaces or disturbs niches of methanotrophs. These results help to explain what drives spatial and temporal variability of methane emissions in coastal areas. To summarize, our findings suggest that a decrease in faunal abundance will decrease marine methane emissions by allowing more opportunity for benthic methanotrophs to oxidize methane.",5,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Whether these changes will affect ecosystem functioning remains largely unknown. To study whether today’s community differentiation among biogeographic regions and depth zones reflects differences in OM utilization and food-web structure, stable isotope analysis was used. Benthic fauna and OM mixtures were collected from two depth zones (100-150 m vs 200-250 m) within an Arctic, two sub-Arctic, and a temperate fjord along a latitudinal gradient (59-78°N). Our results show that Arctic and temperate communities are functionally different. Arctic communities showed a strong resource partitioning among different feeding types irrespective of depth zone. In contrast, all feeding types in temperate communities seem to rely on the same OM source. The sub-Arctic currently presents a transition zone. In the sub-Arctic, shallower communities resemble Arctic communities, suggesting a functional transition between temperate and sub-Arctic region. Deeper sub-Arctic communities resemble temperate communities, suggesting a functional transition between sub-Arctic and Arctic region.

We use these characteristics to define ecosystem response footprints in terms of their spatial extent and depth (a measure of the magnitude of effects) and link these attributes to suitable actions for generating ecological recovery and resilience.

Here, we investigated macrofaunal biodiversity change in free-living red coralline algal habitats around the Fernando de Noronha archipelago, Brazil, from euphotic to mesophotic depths (13-86 m). These habitats, known as rhodolith or maerl beds, are global biodiversity hotspots. We found a gradient of macrofaunal biodiversity decline with depth; distinct euphotic/mesophotic shifts were not evident. Macrofaunal biodiversity was negatively associated with water depth and some rhodolith host taxa, and positively associated with rhodolith thallus diameter. The gradient in ecosystem niche provision may be in part driven by coralline algae’s superior capacity for mesophotic light acclimation – a process we have experimentally defined. Taxa with low total abundance were most responsive to driver change and therefore may be highly sensitive to global change trajectories. However, dispersion among communities (i.e. beta-diversity) was highest at the deepest depths and the major taxa exhibited limited depth specificity.

Their ability to drive ecosystems is a function of size, density, and activity; all of which can be difficult to quantify in terms of &nbsp;mechanisms. Unraveling the mechanisms that drive the functioning of these systems ultimately depends on our characterization of how the organisms interact over aspects of food, space, fertilization, toxicity, depth, sediment characters, etc. and how those interactions are manifest in rates of growth, movement, dispersal, mortality, reproduction, etc. These are the natural history characters of organisms. The recognition and quantification of natural history in our models and experiments determines the difference between merely describing the functioning of the system and its correlates and understanding the underlying mechanisms. My task, according to the organizers, is to explore the importance of natural history to ecosystem function, hopefully incorporating aspects of scale, emergent properties, and tipping points.",0,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

The stability of communities can be linked to the trait assemblage present, but for submerged plant communities, the knowledge on which traits are critical for community stability is lacking. In a long-term field experiment (5 years), our aim was&nbsp;to assess how plant trait diversity relates to plant community recovery in the northern Baltic Sea. To study this,&nbsp;we simulated drift algal coverage and exposed plant communities composed of marine and limnic species at three sites with varying trait diversity (FDis, low-medium-high) to decreased light availability and water O<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>concentrations for 4 weeks, resulting in&nbsp;extensive plant mortality in the plots (2 m<sup>2</sup>, n=4 per site). We monitored the recovery of the plots by frequently assessing community composition and traits (e.g. Specific leaf area (SLA), Maximum shoot height (Hmax) and Rhizome carbohydrate concentration). In addition to natural meadow dynamics, our results show that after 5 years, none of the communities had&nbsp;fully recovered to ambient levels, but the communities with medium FDis&nbsp;were&nbsp;furthermost in their recovery process. These communities were&nbsp;composed of small to medium-sized plants (low Hmax) with low SLA and low rhizome carbohydrate storage. As submerged plant meadows are dynamic systems facing multiple pressures, recovery can be difficult to discern.

One opportunity to make sense of these systems is the use of biological traits that reflect the potential options for ecological communities to respond to stress (i.e., response capacity). To investigate the cumulative effects of turbidity and elevated nutrients on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and response capacity we conducted a large-scale experiment manipulating sediment nutrient concentrations at 24 sites in 15 estuaries that spanned a gradient in turbidity. A network analysis of macrofauna traits associated with resistance to stress, ability to recover and regulate ecosystem functions revealed natural variation in trait network complexity (i.e. response capacity) across the sites. &nbsp;Sites with higher baseline complexity exhibited less variable responses to additional stress. The loss of response capacity with nutrient stress was associated with decreases in species richness but the impacts on ecosystem multifunctionality depended on turbidity: in clear estuaries species loss did not reduce functioning but in more turbid estuaries it did. &nbsp;Our results show that even subtly stressed ecosystems have lower response capacity and when exposed to additional stressors negatively impacts on ecosystem functioning.",4,,6/7/23 10:30,6/7/23 12:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Previously insights into the sometimes devasting effects of heatwaves on benthic ecosystems were obtained either through observations after heatwaves had already occurred or through manipulative laboratory experiments. We developed a novel approach for inducing elevated water temperatures in benthic habitats <em>in situ</em> over several days. The system utilizes domestic under-floor heating technology combined with custom-made benthic chambers. We conducted a 15-day study in July 2021 in a bare-sediment habitat at 2.5 m depth exposing 5 chambers to water temperatures 5°C above ambient temperatures for 6 days and comparing with 5 control chambers. Sediment cores were collected from each chamber to assess the effects of a realistic marine heatwave on natural benthic communities and incubations during light and dark hours were performed to assess changes in ecosystem functioning (solute fluxes). The results indicate that while the benthic community structure remained similar between the treatments, elevated temperatures caused an increase in the magnitude of either efflux or influx of O<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and Si.

The resulting community structure has a direct effect on many ecosystem processes and functions. Still, the relationship between functional diversity of marine benthos and its trophic (isotopic) diversity in response to the variability of food remains poorly investigated. To explore this relationship we focused on the assessment of different facets of macrobenthic diversity in two temperate coastal areas (southern Baltic Sea) characterized by similar habitat properties but different OM sources and supplies. In our study, benthic functional trait dispersion - FDis followed the isotopic (trophic) dispersion - IDis (R = 0.75), indicating the positive relationship between food variability and ecological functions of marine benthic communities. In location with lower quantity but higher quality of OM, benthic assemblages were dominated by suspension-feeding surficial biodiffusors, whereas in location with available but more refractory OM (riverine input), assemblages were more functionally diverse with higher biomass of surface-feeding deep biodiffusors and conveyors. Moreover, functional structure in shallow areas (15 m) was more location specific in comparison to deeper areas (30 m), and this variability was significantly related to OM parameters. Our study indicates that both isotopic and functional facets of benthic community diversity and structure in shallow coastal areas of the southern Baltic are interactive and susceptible to OM variability.",1,,6/8/23 8:30,6/8/23 10:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

These sites were studied over 4 seasons (November, February, May, August 2022). The main objective of this work is to study the different distributions of foraminiferal populations within the sites at a seasonal level and to evaluate the ecology of species determining tolerant and opportunistic to anthropogenic impacts. To this end, sedimentological and biogeochemical characteristics of the sediments were identified by measuring grain size, temperature, oxygen, salinity, pH, pigment concentration (Chlorophyll a and Phaeopigments), total organic carbon, and stable isotopes of the organic matter. On the basis of these environmental data, three domains can be distinguished, the subtidal domain, the intertidal domain and the harbour domain, showing a gradient of organic supply as well as very contrasted microbial activity highlighted by carbon and sulphur isotopic ratios. Our faunal results show a restrained abundance but highest diversity in the harbour associated to the dominance of &lt;em&gt;Haynesina germanica&lt;/em&gt; suggesting a particular tolerance of this species to anthropic impacts.

The species were separately incubated in natural sediment in the laboratory under ambient, low pH (pH -0.3), warm (+ 3 °C) and mimicked climate change (pH -0.3, +3 °C) conditions. After six weeks of incubation, nutrient and oxygen exchange were measured at the sediment-water interface to estimate aerobic sediment metabolism and nitrogen cycling. Both species facilitated sediment metabolism and nitrogen cycling, including coupled nitrification-denitrification therewith counteracting eutrophication. The stimulatory effect of <em>A. alba </em>disappeared in a low pH environment and decreased over time in the warmer treatments along with increased mortality. In contrast, <em>L. conchilega </em>stimulated sediment biogeochemical cycling more when seawater becomes acidified but&nbsp; warming had no effect.

It could be expected, that since a large number of attributes is shared between confamilial species, these organisms are likely to cluster together in this r-K range and therefore families could be used for global ecological quality indicators. In this context, the GloBenth project aimed to quantify and compare the sensitivity of benthic taxa to disturbance in different regions of the world. To quantify taxa (family in this case) sensitivity to disturbance, the tolerance score ES50<sub>0.05</sub> was calculated in a series of large data sets from different geographic regions. This score reflects the minimum diversity that 95% of a taxon's specimens can tolerate. The tolerance scores were estimated for different geographic regions and then families were categorized based on their tolerance-to-disturbance stability across different regions. More specifically, families of benthic organisms were separated into four types: (<em>i</em>) those with low abundance and low variance in tolerance score across the different regions, (<em>ii</em>) those with high abundances and low variance, (<em>iii</em>) those with low abundances and high variance and, (<em>iv</em>) those with high abundances and high variance.

While long and severe (or extreme) heatwaves often have more destructive effects, the more subtle effects of moderate (or strong) shorter-term heatwaves may nevertheless affect ecosystem functioning through complex, context-dependent linkages between different processes. We conducted a laboratory experiment to study the effects of repeated short-term, strong MHWs on macrofauna bioturbation and associated solute fluxes as a measure of ecosystem functioning using natural soft-sediment communities from the Baltic Sea. Our results showed changes in both bioturbation and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients following short-term, strong heatwaves, which seemed to contribute to an enhanced degradation of organic matter in the seafloor and an enhanced exchange of solutes across the sediment-water interface as well as increased sediment oxygen consumption. Following changes in these processes, the relative contribution of macrofauna and the environmental context to ecosystem functioning was altered. Our results highlight the potential of even shorter-term, strong MHWs of having system-wide impacts due to changes in the mechanistic process of bioturbation underpinning the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.

Environmental oxygen was not a strong predictor of fish abundance. More fishes were observed at higher habitat temperatures and over or on soft sediment types than at colder temperatures and hard substrates. Anthropogenic debris was observed frequently across dive sites, to depths greater than 6000 m, demonstrating human impacts on these deep-sea ecosystems.

However, biotic and abiotic drivers of N cycling processes in large shelf areas remain overlooked. In this study, rates of N removal were measured by the revised isotope pairing technique (r-IPT) along the North-eastern New Zealand shelf. Denitrification dominated N removal with average rates (±SE) ranging from 65 ± 28 to 284 ± 72 µmol N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Denitrification was positively correlated with macrofauna abundance, and negatively correlated with oxygen penetration depth.

Parallel microbial community analysis revealed Proteobacteria and Planctomycetota communities as the key denitrifiers. Overall, New Zealand shelf appears to play a critical role in removing fixed N under current conditions. Measured denitrification rates in New Zealand shelf were 30 to 52 % lower than those from nutrient-rich areas in the Northern Hemisphere. We reassessed the rate of global shelf denitrification to be 28 ± 12 Tg N yr<sup>-1</sup>, which contributes 10 ± 2% of marine N removal.

Classic ecological models were generally supported, but the details of how differed over time and space.&nbsp;For example, in the wet year (2019), predation reduced species richness at high-salinity sites but not low-salinity sites, nor did it&nbsp;influence composition. In a drier year (2020), predation influenced composition only at high-salinity sites, but had no effect on species richness.

Sediment reworking and bioirrigation were investigated in controlled lab experiments using five levels of organic enrichment on cores with different animal densities. <em>Hediste diversicolor </em>bioturbation and bioirrigation rates were not affected by organic enrichment levels, suggesting no loss of community function. However, reduced densities were associated with increased diffusive bioturbation rate, yet shallower reworking. For <em>Cerastoderme edule</em>, reduced density levels were also associated with increased yet shallower bioturbation. Additionally, a significant interaction was found with increased organic enrichment, further decreasing the bioturbation rate.

Because of their large populations and high feeding rates, dreissenids now dominate elements of Great Lakes nutrient budgets. Dreissenids also replaced the bioturbating amphipod <em>Diporeia</em> as the dominant benthic invertebrate in the Great Lakes, leading to changes in fauna-sediment interactions. Most previous studies on dreissenid impacts have focused on nearshore regions, and little is known about the effects of dense mussel populations in unproductive profundal lake regions. To quantify dreissenid contribution to offshore nutrient cycling, we measured mussel nutrient cycling rates and stoichiometry at sites spanning large trophic status and depth gradients in Lakes Michigan and Huron. To determine the consequences of dreissenid colonization on sediment mixing and benthic nutrient fluxes in low organic matter offshore sediments, we performed mesocosm experiments with quagga mussels and native Great Lakes benthos (<em>Diporeia </em>and oligochaetes). Our results show that dreissenid nutrient cycling rates and excretion stoichiometry are highly variable and likely have a large impact on lake nutrient budgets. However, when sediment OM concentrations are low, dreissenids do not significantly alter benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes – despite mixing sediment at considerably lower rates than <em>Diporeia</em> and oligochaetes.

Understanding such state shifts is crucial for ecological restoration projects, since active replanting of aquatic vegetation may be required to reach the desired ecosystem state. This project aims to restore a handful of shallow coastal bays along the central Swedish Baltic Sea coast. A survey of local ecological knowledge of the study bays showed that the environmental condition in the bays has deteriorated during the last decades, including dramatic loss of SAV or changes in species composition from stonewort meadows to a dominance by tall competitive species.

During the last years, seagrass populations are decreasing dramatically due, mostly, to anthropogenic factors. Interaction between species plays an important role in this process. Competition or antagonistic relations with exotic species can alter the structure of the meadow. The interaction with other native species in a global change context, especially when the species have different tolerances to the new conditions, also affects the population dynamics. In this paper, we study the interaction between two seagrass species, from a macroscopic point of view. In this framework, the changes in the species' densities are described by a system of two coupled partial differential equations. These equations describe the clonal reproduction of the plants, and are coupled by the mortality term to describe interactions between the species. The interspecific interaction has been considered local and nonlinear, allowing low-density facilitation and large-density saturation. The proposed model shows several scenarios, such as mixed and monospecies homogeneous solutions, oscillations, domains separated by fronts, and spatiotemporal turbulence. Furthermore, the transitions between different states depend on abiotic factors.

This was also observed at seagrass growing on the tidal flats in the European Wadden Sea, especially in the 1970s – 1990s. However, a long-term aerial and field monitoring revealed that seagrass beds in the northern Wadden Sea have recovered for the last 25 years. This is primarily ascribed to a reduction of nutrient discharges from large rivers commencing in the mid 1980s. From the late 1990s to 2011, seagrasses have increased 5-fold in bed area. Hence, the visible part of the recovery started with a delay of about 10 years after the nutrient reduction measure. After a phase of a rather stable seagrass bed area, a slight but steady increase can be observed again since 2017. A habitat model revealed that suitable areas are by now almost completely occupied and for the last years, seagrass is expanding in areas with marginal suitability. The seagrass beds are composed of two species: Z. marina which prefers wetter habitats whereas Z. noltei which is more tolerant to low tide exposure and the clearly dominant species. However, over the last 7 years, a distinct increase of Z. marina was observed. It is often expanding in areas adjoining tidal channel deltas but the share of Z. marina has also increased in dense beds dominated by Z. noltei. We assume that Z. noltei delays water drainage with their dense canopy and hereby increasing the habitat suitability for Z. marina.

Relationships between primary producer hosts and their parasites follow stoichiometrically predictable patterns, with decreased parasite performance under nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) limitation (i.e., low P:C or N:C ratios). However, host defense may also be nutrient dependent, particularly N, restricting the ability of cells to invest in their immunity under N limitation (i.e., low N:C ratios). We tested the effects N:C ratios on interactions between host and parasite growth, and host defense. To this end, we developed a stoichiometric disease model where host growth and defense, as well as parasite infections depend on N. The model revealed an optimum for infection rates at intermediate host N:C ratios. At lower host N:C ratios, the parasite became limited by nitrogen, while at high host N:C ratios infection was inhibited by host defense. We verified these findings with a green algal host infected by a fungal parasite (i.e., chytrid) exposed to a gradient in N availability. These findings were largely in line with the model outcome, showing reduced infections at both the lowest and highest N treatments. Overall, our findings demonstrate that nutrients can modulate host-parasite interactions through various processes, providing a mechanistic base for understanding disease dynamics.",1,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

However, the relative roles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), inorganic carbon (via light availability for photosynthesis), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability for biofilm properties and the associated control of C, N and P assimilation by biofilms remain poorly understood. Here we present results from a full factorial stream mesocosm experiment to investigate how reactive DOC:N:P ratios (as DOC, nitrate-N (NO<sub>3</sub>-N) and phosphate-P (PO<sub>4</sub>-P)) and light availability (10 and 46 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s) affect the heterotrophic and autotrophic structure and function of benthic and hyporheic biofilms. Due to high NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations, the background reactive DOC:N:P ratio was 317:1572:1, indicating low relative availability of DOC and P. The addition of reactive C and P sources resulted in a reactive DOC:N:P ratio of 97:47:1, more similar to typical ratios of bacteria and algae. Altered reactive nutrient ratios increased bacterial density and heterotrophic functional diversity in both benthic and hyporheic biofilms, whereas light increased autotrophic functional diversity only when combined with altered DOC:N:P ratios. Our data confirm that the ratio of reactive macronutrients is an important driver of benthic and hyporheic biofilm composition and function, and interacts differently with autotrophic and heterotrophic components.

For this purpose, we examined previous literature data on the composition of the zooplankton community in different Patagonian lakes with and without fish (introduced mainly in the XX century) and own laboratory and field experiments. The ecological stoichiometry theory predicts that consumers need to attain specific elemental ratios to achieve maximum growth, and the geometric framework of nutrition proposes that consumers may need to combine food items to fulfill nutrient requirements. We show that the predaceous copepod does not necessarily encounter prey that fulfills their stoichiometric requirements, thus growth is impaired. However, through the combination of different prey, this predator can fulfill its requirements. In the presence of fishes, food webs change towards smaller-sized zooplankton species with the loss of low C:nutrient ratio species. In this sense, we demonstrate the direct and indirect impact of fish introduction on the stoichiometric balances and the disappearance of this invertebrate predator in lacustrine food webs.",5,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

How intraspecific variation alters ecological processes is therefore a critical question. Here we use mathematical models validated with lab experiments to examine how traits relating to the acquisition and processing of elements alter consumer-mediated nutrient recycling. We focus on four traits: organismal stoichiometry, assimilation efficiency, consumption rate, and allocation, and three response variables: excretion rates, egestion rates, and the relative balance between egestion and excretion. We compare the sensitivity of two different bioenergetic-stoichiometry models to intraspecific variation in the traits. We find that both models are&nbsp; sensitive to intraspecific variation, but that sensitivity varies depending on ontogeny and nutrient limitation. Furthermore, the responses of egestion and excretion differed substantially. We are currently assessing how the models perform under realistic ranges of organismal stoichiometry, consumption rate, assimilation efficiency, allocation collected from a large laboratory study comparing different populations of the same species of fish. Our findings suggest that incorporating intraspecific variation, currently absent from the majority of theoretical models of excretion and egestion, is important for prediction, and that theoretical models are useful for elucidating mechanisms by which intraspecific variation alters ecosystem functions.",0,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

As phytoplankton’s efficiency in light use ultimately depends on the taxon-specific set of pigments, underwater light spectrum can be a crucial factor in shaping phytoplankton communities and stoichiometry. We conducted an incubation experiment to determine the combined effects of nutrients (ambient, enriched), light quantity (two incubation depths), and light quality (full, blue, green, red spectrum) on a natural phytoplankton community in an oligotrophic lake. We expected full and blue spectrum to favor more diverse communities due to a higher complementarity with community pigments which results in higher particulate carbon (C) concentrations and higher C to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) ratios, especially under ambient conditions. We observed that nutrient enrichment led to an extensive shift in the community from cryptophytes to diatoms and overall decreased C:P ratios, irrespective of the light intensity. Effects of light spectrum on stoichiometry depended on both, the nutrient regime and the light intensity. While under lower light intensity and ambient nutrient conditions the highest C:nutrient ratios were observed for full and blue spectrum, this was not the case at higher light intensities and high nutrient conditions.

The magnitude of limitation and whether N, P, or both are limiting growth depends on their supply and ratios. Previous studies identified single, serial or co-limitation as dominant limitation outcomes in phytoplankton communities. Little is known about how such limitation outcomes may affect food quality for zooplankton. In experimental microcosms, we grew 3 phytoplankton communities that differed in their composition of distantly related phylogenetic groups at varying N and P concentrations resulting in 3 N:P ratios. At carrying capacity, N, P, both or none were added to reveal which nutrients were limiting. We found phytoplankton communities being growth-limited either by N alone (single limitation), serially (primarily by N and secondarily by P), by both nutrients independently (both N &amp; P were limiting), or simultaneously (only the addition of both nutrients together alleviated growth limitation). The C:P and N:P ratios of phytoplankton biomass changed substantially among the different N:P supply ratios, whereas phytoplankton C:N ratio changed less. Differences in fatty acid composition were mainly driven by differences in community composition and only little by stoichiometric supply ratios. Thus, food quality for zooplankton may be affected rather by essential fatty acids if there are drastic changes in phytoplankton community composition, whereas stoichiometric food quality may play a bigger role when phytoplankton is limited by P, N or both nutrients.",5,475,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

While the GRH has been supported in previous work, findings are not always concordant with its predictions. Thus we need to better understand the conditions under which the GRH holds and when it does not. We tested the hypotheses that the strength of the GRH depends on metabolic strategy (organoheterotroph vs photoautotroph) and/or on resource limitation by growing P. putida (organoheterotroph) and C. reinhardtii (photoautotroph) in chemostats at 20% and 80% of their maximum growth rates while manipulating media N:P ratios or energy supply (labile organic carbon or light). Biomass P content increased with growth in both taxa in all treatments but especially under P limitation. These P increases lowered biomass C:P and N:P in some treatments (strongest under P limitation). RNA generally increased with growth in both taxa but not for C. reinhardtii under light limitation. In contrast to expectation, the percentage of cellular P explained by P in RNA decreased at faster growth in C. reinhardtii in all treatments and under carbon-limitation in P. putida, perhaps due to P storage.

Homeostatic strength varies considerably among and within species but its adaptive costs and benefits have received little attention. While strict homeostasis may be expected to secure optimal body functioning in the face of stoichiometric mismatch, it comes with the disadvantage of growth being constrained by the element in shortest supply and the need to efficiently discard excess elements. Conversely, plasticity, the opposite of homeostasis, reflects flexibility regarding the utilization efficiency of the limiting element and storage capacity of excess elements but may also reflect an inability to deal with elemental imbalance, especially when related with fitness reductions. To evaluate the adaptive benefit associated with homeostasis, we cultured 14 clones of the planktonic herbivore <em>Brachionus calyciflorus</em> with phosphorus sufficient (HP) and deficient algae (LP) and measured somatic P content and population growth rate. Genotypes with the highest somatic P in HP had highest fitness but suffered the strongest reductions in somatic P and fitness in LP.

While one well-studied “symptom” of the urban stream syndrome is increased nutrient loading, the relative stoichiometry of these nutrients (e.g., nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) may also be unique in urban streams due to organismal responses to other urban stressors. Urbanization may alter the stoichiometric traits of aquatic organisms by selecting for sets of traits with a common stoichiometric signature, which may in turn alter the relative storage and fluxes of key elements like N and P in urban streams. We hypothesize that unpredictable hydrology, elevated maximum temperatures, and increased concentrations of salts associated with urbanization select for taxa with low body C:P and N:P because these taxa must exhibit rapid growth rates and/or come from marine-derived lineages with greater salt tolerance. Both rapidly growing insects and salt-tolerant crustaceans have relatively low body C:P and body N:P, albeit for different biological reasons. We also suggest that the effects of urbanization on stoichiometric traits should be strongest at high latitudes, where urban heat island effects and use of deicing salts create a strongly differentiated fitness landscape.

A less acknowledged threat to the coherence of consumer-resource dynamics is mismatch in food <em>quality</em>. Many plant and algal communities respond to warming with shifts towards more carbon-rich species and growth forms, thus diluting essential elements in their biomass and enhancing the mismatch with herbivore nutrient requirements. We report on a mesocosm experiment with a spring plankton community where warming caused a dramatic regime shift that coincided with extreme stoichiometric mismatch. At ambient temperatures, a typical spring succession developed, where a moderate bloom of nutritionally adequate phytoplankton was grazed down to a clear-water phase by a developing <em>Daphnia</em> population. While warming accelerated initial <em>Daphnia</em> population growth, it speeded up algal growth rates even more, triggering a massive phytoplankton bloom of poor food quality. Consistent with a stoichiometric producer-grazer model, accelerated phytoplankton growth promoted the emergence of an alternative system attractor, where extremely low phosphorus content of abundant algal food drove <em>Daphnia</em> to extinction. The experiment is a demonstration of the ‘paradox of energy enrichment’ (= grazer starvation in abundant but nutritionally imbalanced food). It supports the notion that warming can exacerbate the stoichiometric mismatch at the plant-herbivore interface and limit energy transfer to higher trophic levels.",2,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

In this study, we seek to understand the relationship between PyOM production and vegetation burn severity through a comprehensive characterization of dissolved PyOM generated along a burn severity continuum. We used a combination of optical techniques, ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry, and benzene polycarboxylic acids to characterize leachates from chars generated in open-air conditions at varying degrees of burn severity with vegetation representative of Pacific Northwest land cover types. We highlight an independence in PyOM molecular signatures across vegetation types from raw and lower burn severities that ultimately converge at higher severities into uniform signatures characteristic of degraded, aromatic DOM with enriched nitrogen containing functionality.

However, the hydrothermal sources are still not well constrained. We hypothesize that DOS and DBC are mobilized from deep subsurface sediments via hydrothermal heating. The Guaymas Basin (GB) is ideal to study these processes since sill intrusions into the sediments result in thermal alteration of organic matter and thus pore water chemistry. We investigated pore water and sediments collected during IODP Expedition 385. DOM was characterized molecularly using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). DOS concentrations were quantified with elemental analysis and DBC as benzenepolycarboxylic acids. Our results revealed three reaction zones in the GB subsurface: the upper sediments were characterized by active microbial decomposition of DOM. In the deeper sediments, DOM accumulated, partly due to in situ formation of DOS and BC solubilization from sediments. At the sill contact zone, heat-induced molecular alterations reduced the DOM molecular diversity.

Therefore, sediments constitute an important environmental compartment for determining the distribution and emission sources of BC. The BC term encompasses a wide range of combustion continuum generated during the incomplete combustion of organic matter. The quantification of the polycondensed aromatic fraction of BC can be performed by oxidizing BC to generate benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs). These compounds have been widely applied as specific markers to quantify and characterize pyrogenic carbon (PyC) in environmental matrices. In order to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle is essential to disentangle the sources, fate and composition of the organic carbon accumulated in marine sediments. Our results show a preferential accumulation of BPCAs in sediments in a latitudinal band, which indicates an association with PyC emissions from Savannah wildfires. The isotopic signature for B6CA and B5CA indicates C4-type plants as the main source of PyC. In contrast, the isotopic signature of continentally-derived n-alkanes is consistent with C3-type plants. Therefore, the isotopic data indicates that there are two different sources of continentally-derived organic carbon. The PyC source is quantitatively dominant and is related to the burning of African savannah ecosystems.

Annual burning of crop fields in central Africa provides a large source of BC, that may be transported by winds to the equatorial Atlantic and deposited within the intertropical convergence zone. Here, we assessed whether the transport of BC from biomass burning in western Tropical Africa dominates sedimentary black carbon concentrations in the eastern equatorial Atlantic Ocean. We collected multi cores along a 5˚ N transect of the Atlantic Ocean and isolated black carbon using the chemothermal oxidation at 375 ˚C method. BC concentrations decreased westward across the Equatorial Atlantic, with the highest concentrations (0.717 mg/g) north of the Sierra Leon Rise and lowest (0.296 mg/g) west of the mid Atlantic ridge. Source identification using stable carbon isotopes of BC depicted a westward depletion from C4 plants towards C3 plants or fossil fuel dominated values (-17.36 ‰ to -21.02 ‰). The age of surface sedimentary BC in the eastern equatorial Atlantic was younger than the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) (BC: 1460 ± 15 yrs. vs. TOC: 2180 ± 20 yrs.). At least in the eastern equatorial Atlantic, BC had a unique signature from C4 plants that is relatively young and likely originating from biomass burning in Africa.

Like PyOM, dissolved PyOM (PyDOM) properties vary predictably along a combustion continuum, but the effects of environmental aging on PyDOM characteristics are not well-established. Wildfire-derived chars aged for 1, 4, and 30 (GDS-30) years were collected from the Great Dismal Swamp, USA and analyzed for their solid and aqueous leachate chemical characteristics. Solid <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopic and elemental analyses show GDS-30 to have the highest %O and lowest %C and aromatic C contents suggesting it to have the lowest charring extent of the 3 study chars. However, benzenepolycarboxylic acid (BPCA) marker analyses reveal GDS-30 to have the highest BPCA yield and highest degree of aromatic condensation consistent with the opposite conclusion (highest charring extent). In PyDOM leachates, increased char aging correlates with increased DOC and BPCA yields and FTICR-MS-derived aromatic and low O/C molecular formulas. We hypothesize that hydrological and oxidative aging processes 1) deliver allochthonous materials yielding higher PyOM H/C and O/C ratios, and 2) selectively remove an oxygenated, less aromatic portion of the initial PyOM. Subsequently, only the most highly condensed aromatic compounds are available for oxidation and transport as PyDOM, and PyDOM molecular characteristics are better explained by an aging continuum than a combustion continuum.",2,,6/7/23 10:30,6/7/23 12:00,Sala Portixol 1,

We quantified local adaptation of copper tolerance in two populations of the coastal diatom <em>Skeletonema marinoi</em> originating from a mining-exposed inlet of the Baltic Sea and a reference site. We hypothesized that centuries of mining pollution have driven evolution of elevated copper tolerance in <em>S. marinoi</em>.

However, variance within populations was greater at the mining site, with three strains displaying hyper-tolerant phenotypes. Next, we tested if we could evolve populations in an artificial evolution experiment. To this end we used a novel intraspecific metabarcoding locus to track strain selection of all strains during co-cultivation in a control and a copper treatment. As predicted, the hyper-tolerant strains enabled rapid evolution of copper tolerance in the mining exposed population through selection on available strain diversity. Within 42 days a single strain dominated each experimental replicate, with different outcomes for the two treatments. We also detected plastic responses leading to reversible copper tolerance.

Arctic phytoplankton at base of the foodweb in one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet, are faced with especially large changes, but often show high resilience. Among these changes are more frequent and intense heatwaves, which expose organisms to vast temperature fluctuations.

In these DIP-deplete zones, dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) comprises most of the dissolved P pool as P esters (C-O-P bonds) and phosphonates (C-P bonds). Phosphonates, known to comprise approximately 10% of the DOP pool, were thought to be used solely by marine prokaryotes, though recent studies have shown utilization by some eukaryotic phytoplankton species as well. The marine haptophyte, Isochrysis galbana, was grown in P-replete, P-deficient, and phosphonate-amended media to investigate mechanisms of phosphonate utilization via RNA-Seq. A de-novo transcriptome assembly and subsequent annotation was completed and used to characterize differential gene expression. Prokaryotic phosphonate utilization orthologs were found in the I. galbana&nbsp;transcriptome, and were differentially expressed in all three DIP-stressed treatments when compared to the P-replete treatment. The results suggest that multiple pathways for phosphonate utilization may be present in eukaryotes, and while under P-stress, cells may express genes related to P scavenging and DOP utilization. As the ocean is predicted to become more stratified, those eukaryotic phytoplankton that can utilize phosphonates may have an evolutionary advantage, ultimately having large impacts on biogeochemical cycling and the biological carbon pump.",2,488,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

We combined population genomics (whole-genome resequencing) with transcriptomics of natural populations spanning the Baltic Sea salinity cline. Genotype-environment association analyses revealed that more than 3000 genes showed signals of selection in response to the Baltic Sea environmental gradients, which apart from salinity, includes marked differences in temperature and nutrient availability. These adaptive genes are related to various metabolic processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle, DNA methylation, and maintenance of homeostasis. The adaptive genes showed significant overlap with differentially expressed genes in a common garden experiment of salinity change in eight Baltic <em>S. marinoi </em>strains, suggesting the Baltic salinity gradient is a major factor in driving local adaption of <em>S. marinoi</em>.

While the species appears to be expanding in distribution and bloom frequency in Europe, similar trends are not observed in North America. Population genetics in protists, however, is severely hampered by the need to culture strains of clonal isolates to obtain enough DNA for generating genomic libraries. We developed and implemented the analysis of single amplified genomes (SAGs) followed by restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to bypass labor-intensive culturing and avoid culturing bias in population genomic studies of microeukaryotes. This novel approach (SAG-RAD) allowed us to sample cells from <em>G. semen</em> populations across Europe and North America without subsequent culturing. Using SAG-RAD, we identified two distinct population clusters, with higher genetic similarity within than between the continents. Clear geographic population structure within each continent was associated with differences in environmental variables which potentially drove local adaptation and ecological divergence of population clusters.

Rising temperatures accelerate biophysical and biochemical processes: The Q10 law predicts 15-90% stimulation of such biological rates under different IPCC temperature scenarios. However, stimulation in the individual processes is only observed below process-specific thermal optima; above those, warming impacts physiology and compromises vital functions. We hypothesized that organismic temperature responses originate from diverging physiological processes, which likely result in metabolic mismatches beyond thermal optima. To test this, we assessed multiple functional traits (e.g. growth, production, elemental and pigment quota) across a wide temperature spectrum in diverse Arctic phytoplankton species. Thermal scopes differed in both, the width of the thermal niches and the shape of their performance curves: While cellular growth typically followed an optimum curve, carbon quotas often exhibited U- or bell-shaped behavior. We identified the interplay between cell division rates and net carbon uptake as the main control for these trait specific differences among taxa. Currently, we are looking into underlying physiological processes (e.g. photosynthetic and respiratory O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fluxes) to determine metabolic bottlenecks under future temperature scenarios to improve our understanding about detrimental temperature effects.",4,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Sala Menorca B,

The model system comprised of <em>Chaetoceros affinis</em> and <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em> exposed to different nutrient regimes over approximately 130 generations. To allow for rapid intraspecific trait changes via genotype selection, the experiment started with a standing genetic diversity of nine genotypes per species. We demonstrate that most changes in community mean trait and property changes towards different nutrient regimes were attributable to shifts in species composition. However, the contribution of intraspecific trait variation differed considerably in response to different nutrient regimes. While intraspecific contribution decreased over time in the 10 µmol*L-1 Nitrate and 1 µmol*L-1 phosphate (10N:1P) environment it increases in the 30N:1P environment. The latter increase could be attributed to the emergent phenotypic plasticity of one remaining diatom genotype.

The relationship between nutrient concentration and population growth rate is critical to predict how members of aquatic communities respond to environmental perturbations. Models of this response, such as the widely used Monod model, are generally characterized by a maximum growth rate and a half-saturation concentration of the resource. What values should we expect for these half-saturation concentrations, and how should they depend on the resource concentration in nature? We survey growth response data across a wide range of resources and microbial taxa, including many phytoplankton. We find that the half-saturation concentrations vary across orders of magnitude, even for the same organism and resource. To explain this variation, we develop an evolutionary model to show that demographic fluctuations (genetic drift) can constrain the adaptation of half-saturation concentrations. We find that this effect fundamentally differs depending on the type of population dynamics: Populations undergoing periodic bottlenecks of fixed size will adapt their half-saturation concentrations in proportion to the environmental resource concentrations, but populations undergoing periodic dilutions of fixed size will evolve half-saturation concentrations that are largely decoupled from the environmental concentrations. Our model provides testable predictions on how the ability for low concentration growth is distributed across microbial habitats and along resource gradients, but it also reveals how an evolved half-saturation concentration may not reflect the organism’s environment.&nbsp; In particular, this explains how taxa in resource-rich environments can still evolve fast growth at low resource concentrations.",5,,6/9/23 8:30,6/9/23 10:00,Sala Menorca B,

It is a multi-trait phenotype that involves reduction of metabolic rates, developmental arrest, increased longevity and protection against cellular stress. However, a high-throughput method that screens for this phenotypic trait has yet to be developed for zooplankton. This study focused on post-embryonic dormancy in calanoid copepods.

Using rigorous mathematics and simulations rooted in game theory we examined different strategies to maximize survival in homogeneous conditions (i.e., lacking environmental heterogeneity as a maintenance mechanism). Collectively, this work has led us to discover that maximal phenotypic heterogeneity (i.e., intra-specific variability) maximizes co-existence of many types of microbes for long time periods. It is noteworthy that this theory and simulations promote co-existence, rather than dominance of individual or few types. Maximal trait-heterogeneity stands in remarkable contrast to selection of optimal phenotypic traits and this juxtaposition requires tailored analytical approaches to investigate its validity. Given the demonstrable degree of physiological, behavioral, and genetic plasticity in situ we suggest that testing this theory by overcoming current methodological limitations has considerable merit.

It is still unclear how consecutive HWs affect coastal plankton communities and their functions within ecosystems. In this regard, an <em>in situ</em> mesocosm experiment was performed in a Mediterranean lagoon for 33 days. Three mesocosms were used as controls following the natural temperature of the lagoon, while in three others two HWs of +5°C compared to the controls were applied from experimental day (d) 1 to d5 (HW1) and from d11 to d15 (HW2), while their temperature was similar to the controls during non-HW periods. High-frequency (every 1 min) data of dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-<em>a</em> (chl-<em>a</em>), temperature, salinity and light from sensors immersed in all mesocosms were used to calculate gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) and phytoplankton growth (µ) and loss (L) rates.

Normal phytoplankton succession from diatoms to haptophytes was altered by both HWs as cyanobacteria and chlorophytes were favored at the expense of haptophytes.

Predator effects cascade down food webs via predator-prey interactions while warming increases metabolic rates, suggesting that climate change effects interact with predators and their prey through consumer processes. However, the direction of effects will depend on both the food web structure and the ability of the consumers to adapt to changing temperatures. We tested the interactive effects of predator loss and warming on trophic interactions by conducting a mesocosm study, using a simplified shallow coastal food web as a model system.

Predator removal modified grazer trait responses to warming, and this effect cascaded further down the food web. Warming and predator presence together reduced crustacean biomass and increased diatom biomass. Predator removal increased the survival and recruitment of crustaceans but decreased gastropod biomass. The results illustrate that warming and predator loss impact both food web dynamics and traits at different trophic levels.&nbsp;",1,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Precipitation events boost the transport of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into lakes, impacting not only ecosystem processes but also the formation of non-desired carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) during drinking water disinfection. A spatially coordinated mesocosm experiment was designed in two Swedish lakes to study the impact of run-off variability on freshwater. To understand to what extent these effects differ with local climate and geography, standardized equipment and methods were applied at both sites. Three different pulse events (carbon and nutrient additions) were studied by varying their intensity and frequency to simulate extreme, intermediate, and continuous rainfall. Results confirmed that changes in concentration and composition of DOM were site-specific, were strongly dependent on run-off variability, and that the effect of pulses in input could be detected by monitoring proxies of DOM in the mesocosms. Also, DBP formation potential tests were performed, showing positive correlations with DOM proxies and sensitivity to pulse disturbances.

Despite rising use of road salt alternatives, research on their toxicities rarely extends beyond individual species, and community and ecosystem-level testing remains limited. We used outdoor mesocosms to test how zooplankton communities, important primary consumers in aquatic systems, responded to three de-icers: rock salt (NaCl), an organic alternative (beet /NaCl-brine), and an inorganic alternative (NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2). Each de-icer was tested along a gradient of 20 concentrations ranging from ~6 to ~1500 mg Cl- /L. We found that both alternatives were more toxic to zooplankton and decreased total abundance at lower concentrations than rock salt. However, the mechanisms of toxicity among de-icers may have differed; a decline in oxygen in the organic alternative correlated with the decline in zooplankton abundance. Within each treatment, cladocerans and copepods were more sensitive than rotifers, indicating differential sensitivities that would impact community composition, species interactions, and ecosystem function. Further, we saw an increase in chlorophyll a, suggesting an ecosystem trophic response likely driven by a loss of grazers. These results suggest that de-icer alternatives might not be as “eco-friendly” as advertised and we advise that additional testing is necessary, especially when considering effects such as trophic interactions.",7,503,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Four treatments were applied: 1) natural planktonic community with ambient water temperature (C); 2) natural planktonic community at +3 °C elevated temperature (T); 3) exclusion of larger zooplankton (&gt; 200 µm) with ambient water temperature (MicroZ); and 4) exclusion of larger zooplankton at +3 °C elevated temperature (TMicroZ). Warming strongly depressed the phytoplankton bloom amplitude as the chlorophyll <em>a</em> concentrations was two times lower in the T treatment, most likely due to the increase of the top-down control by zooplankton. This was supported when the larger zooplankton fraction was removed (MicroZ vs TMicroZ), as in this weakened top-down control conditions, the phytoplankton biomass increased under warming. Warming also modified phytoplankton composition by enhancing smaller green flagellates and dinoflagellates at the expense of diatoms and prymnesiophytes. Finally, warming modified phytoplankton successions, promoting an early bloom of picophytoplankton, mainly small green flagellates, and a late bloom of diatoms. Our findings suggest potentially weaker spring blooms, dominated by smaller phytoplankton and dinoflagellates in the future in coastal waters and point at the role of the top-down pressure intensification on its changes, with potential consequences for coastal food web dynamics and trophic transfer efficiencies under future ocean conditions.",5,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

This leads to changes in the phytoplankton C:N:P elemental composition which impacts consumer growth and thus the energy transfer in the aquatic food-web. However, the current understanding of run-off impacts on producers and consumers is limited as studies on variability in run-off events including multiple trophic levels are rare. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment within the AQUACOSM-plus network at Lake Erken (SITES AquaNet) in Sweden to simulate a rainfall period with different amplitudes and frequencies of nutrient and cDOM pulses. The experimental treatments ranged from one extreme to multiple intermediate and low pulses of nitrate, phosphate and cDOM, with the same total addition, over a period of 20 days. This was followed by a 17-day recovery period without any input. Our results show that the extreme nutrient pulse enables fast recovery of phytoplankton biomass and C:N ratios but leads to phosphorus-driven decreases in C:P and N:P ratios compared to both higher frequency pulses. These effects translate into consumer level with differences between the functional groups of zooplankton (cladocerans and copepods).

AFDM increased by 1.7 times under low flows compared to initial conditions, while there were no significant changes in Chla. Moreover, low flows induced decreases in ER, and especially GPP. We attributed this decrease in photoautotrophic activity to the shading effect caused by the accumulation of fine benthic organic matter on the top of the periphyton. In contrast, at high flows, AFDM did not change, while GPP substantially increased, likely because higher flows induced higher nutrient uptake rates. Our results show that changes in flow velocity can strongly influence periphyton structure and function, which can have further consequences for stream productivity and gas emissions. The implications of our results will be discussed in light of the marked hydrological seasonality of Mediterranean streams.",0,500,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Within the deployment catalogue, dissolved, CO2 non-equilibrated addition is considered realistic, but causes water chemistry perturbations. Among mineral alkalinity sources, carbonates and silicates are recurrently proposed, but can fertilize. As such, research is needed on the effects these can have on ecosystem integrity and services. With food security as a pressing global challenge, the service of food production is of relevance. We studied responses of a temperate zooplankton community and their value as food for fish to different CO2 non-equilibrated OAE scenarios. To do so, large mesocosms were deployed in a Norwegian fjord between May and July 2022. Two OAE gradients, ranging from ambient to delta TA of 600 micromol per L, were established for each of the two minerals, silicates and carbonates. Across the TA range, gradients in pCO2, pH and omega aragonite emerged, with silicate-based OAE entailing an increase in this nutrient. Such changes will likely have direct and indirect effects, through shifts in phytoplankton composition and nutritional value, on zooplankton. To assess the integrity of the community, we analyzed zooplankton diversity and trophic length. Effects on their value as food for fish were addressed via zooplankton biomass, functional composition, CN stoichiometry, population size structure and per capita size. On this basis, we provide a first insight on OAE impacts on the continuity of the service of food production in a temperate community.",9,508,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The consequence of different nutrient/cDOM pulse regimes on phytoplankton communities and the role of legacy effects related to the characteristics of previous exposure regimes, remain largely unresolved. To investigate this, we implemented add-on bottle experiments with water collected from a mesocosm experiment conducted in lake Erken (Sweden) with the following treatments: low intensity-daily pulses (daily), a single pulse with high intensity (extreme) and a control without additions. The same total amount of cDOM and nutrients was added to the daily and extreme treatments over a period of 3 weeks, which was then followed by a 2 week recovery period without further additions. At the end of both periods, water from all mesocosm treatments was filled into microcosms and either exposed to a second single nutrient pulse that corresponded to the extreme mesocosm treatment or left as controls. The microcosms were incubated for 8 days in the lab and changes in phytoplankton biomass and composition were analyzed. Preliminary results show that the phytoplankton responses differed between the mesocosm source treatments, most likely due to differences in initial phytoplankton composition and abundance. Hence, our results suggest that legacy effects may be important in the prediction of phytoplankton community response to extreme nutrient and cDOM pulses.",3,492,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Simple measures to detect aquatic N<sub>2</sub> fluxes are needed. We measured dissolved N<sub>2</sub>:Ar patterns in twelve experimental pond mesocosms representing a N:P input gradient ranging from ~2 to 110 (molar). Low N:P mesocosms had N<sub>2</sub>:Ar saturation ratio values consistently below equilibrium (net N fixation), and high N:P mesocosms had N<sub>2</sub>:Ar values above equilibrium (net denitrification). Both planktonic N fixation estimated from isotope mixing models and N<sub>2</sub> fluxes measured by sediment core incubations confirmed a shift from net N fixation to net denitrification as N:P ratios increased. Photic zone N<sub>2</sub>:Ar saturation ratios were negatively correlated with increasing measured N fixation while saturation ratios from benthic waters were positively correlated with increasing sediment N<sub>2</sub>-N flux. Field measurements of N<sub>2</sub>:Ar ratios in excess of equilibrium in the hypolimnion of 8 off-channel lakes of the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) confirmed that these backwater habitats are significant denitrification habitatsduring summer disconnection from the river. However, we also observed evidence for net N fixation with depleted N<sub>2</sub>:Ar ratios in the epilimnion of all lakes. Our mesocosm results combined with our field study demonstrate that N<sub>2</sub>:Ar ratios can be used to identify hotspots or hot moments of net denitrification and N fixation.

We hypothesized that 1) in systems with hypoxic hypolimnia, DVM decreases and is replaced by higher DHM, and that 2) DVM and DHM are more extensive in lakes with higher fish predation pressure. Through the AQUACOSM Transnational Access program, we sampled zooplankton in 16 experimental ponds (30 m x 15 m x 3 m) at the National Experimental Platform in Aquatic Ecology (PLANAQUA) at the CEREEP-Ecotron ÎledeFrance facility in France. The ponds were manipulated with fish and nutrient treatments (2 levels each) in a 2 x 2 factorial design. We sampled zooplankton in the epilimnion, hypolimnion, and littoral zone&nbsp;of each pond near noon and midnight to characterize migrations. We found that crustacean DVM decreased and DHM was not impacted by lower hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen, partially supporting our first hypothesis. Our second hypothesis was not supported - as planktivore abundance increased, crustacean DVM decreased and DHM was not impacted. Some rotifer genera exhibited weak migration patterns. We discuss trophic and behavioral cascades among crustaceans, rotifers, and <em>Chaoborus</em>&nbsp;in response to gradients of fish planktivory and oxygen.

Since juvenile clams are more sensitive than adults, our main goal was to evaluate the effects of low salinity events on their survival and physiological condition as well as the physiological responses of <em>Z. noltei</em> and their interactions. Mesocosms simulated tidal cycles and three different salinity ramps (5-20, 10-25 and 35-35).

However, after four days at ambient conditions, <em>R. decussatus</em> recovered normal physiological values but most of <em>V. corrugata</em> specimens died. Most of <em>Z. noltei</em> indicators were constant but the sucrose content dropped at the low salinity treatment.

A promising CO<sub>2</sub> removal technology is enhanced silicate weathering (ESW) in coastal systems. The technology is based on natural silicate mineral weathering, which releases alkalinity and thereby increases the seawater’s capacity to dissolve CO<sub>2</sub>. It is though that silicate weathering can be sped up by introducing the minerals in coastal sediments where waves, currents and bioturbation can stimulate the weathering. Although model and laboratory studies suggest ESW is feasible, research on the process in natural conditions is lacking. Hence, the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration efficiency and risks when applying ESW in the field are largely unknown. We present results from the first and longest-running mesocosm experiment investigating ESW and associated CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in coastal marine sediments. In tanks containing natural sediment, we have studied biogeochemical cycling after treatment with the fast-weathering silicate mineral olivine. Lugworms were added to some tanks to investigate the effect of bioturbation on the olivine dissolution rate and the impact of olivine addition on biota. Five years into the experiment, olivine dissolution is obvious from an elevated sedimentary alkalinity release and decreased average olivine grain size. The elevated alkalinity release has further led to higher CO<sub>2</sub> sequestrations in tanks with olivine.

Interestingly, increased temperature strongly increased the rate of whole cell-necromass recycling compared to the unstressed control, while it slightly decreased the rate of lysed cell recycling. Increased salinity did not seem to affect necromass recycling alone or in combination with increased temperature. After stressor removal, necromass recycling rates were not distinguishable from the unstressed control.

An in-lake enclosure experiment was conducted using a natural community, simulating different intensities of nutrient-replete coloured dissolved organic matter (cDOM) runoff. Over six weeks, phytoplankton species composition and biomass were monitored along gradients of light, phosphate and mesozooplankton biomass. Findings indicate that cell size explains phytoplankton community structure during transient reduction in light availability. Initially, the size distribution was unimodal with small-celled species dominating up to 60% of the community biomass. Phosphate addition and mesozooplankton biomass had no effect on phytoplankton size distribution. However, the relative biomass of large-celled species significantly increased as light availability decreased in enclosures with added cDOM.

EVIDENCE FROM A LARGE-SCALE EXPERIMENT,"Climate change-induced alteration of flow regimes is a major threat for organisms inhabiting mountain streams, particularly those experiencing earlier snowmelt. Yet, whole-ecosystem responses to prolonged low flow remain difficult to anticipate. This is mainly because stream food web components can respond differently to prolonged drought, and interactions among them can vary over the drought period. Here, we used large-scale flow-through mesocosms in California’s Sierra Nevada to assess how food webs will respond to end-of-century flow regimes (i.e. advancing snowmelt resulting in earlier flow recession to baseflow levels). We manipulated the flow regime (current versus early low flow treatments) crossed with brown trout presence or absence, across 24 channel sections. Extended low flow increased water temperature and reduced dissolved oxygen. The onset of early low flow immediately conferred a 3-fold increase in the abundance of emerging insects, but this effect was temporary. Flow alteration had a positive and long-lasting effect on cumulative abundance of emerging insects, suggesting that fine-scale changes occurring early in the season influenced the community trajectory. Surprisingly, insects emerged more when trout were present, indicating potential cascading effects on the ecosystem. Our results emphasise that the magnitude and timing of cross-ecosystem subsidies are likely to shift with climate change in mountain streams.

Salinisation resulted in higher phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations in the mesocosms, being more pronounced at salinities &gt;20 g/L. Furthermore, salinisation significantly modified oxygen concentrations and turbidity contrastingly in different climate zones.

This would lead to the replacement of “generalist” species, that would be more tolerant to environmental perturbations, by “specialist” ones relative to well defined ecological niches (mostly the organic matter and nutrients). To explore this hypothesis, we realized a 1-year survey of the microbial colonization within the 16 artificial ponds of the PLANAQUA platform (PLAteforme expérimentale Nationale d'écologie AQUAtique, CEREEP-France), during their first impoundment. For eight of them an enrichment in mineral N and P was performed at the beginning of the phytoplankton growth to stimulate a eutrophication phenomenon. We explored whether the microbial communities and the organic matter, in term of quality, quantity, taxonomical and functional richness, were synchronized, and whether simulation of eutrophication modified these trajectories. To do so, we determined the abundance and the taxonomical and functional diversity of the major microbial groups (phytoplankton, bacteria, archaea and virus), in combination with the diversity of dissolved organic matter (cDOM spectral analysis) and classical <em>in situ</em> multi-parameters. Altogether, these data suggest that microbial communities of these new artificial ecosystems rapidly converged toward those of natural freshwater ecosystems. Our results provide new insight into colonization process and community assembly mechanisms, and underlie the role of the microbial loop in the stability of aquatic ecosystems.",1,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Although elevated nutrient concentrations in freshwaters are a pre-requisite for excessive algal growth, much less is understood about other abiotic factors controlling bloom growth rate and extents. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a series of 990L indoor mesocosm (Limnotron) experiments to investigate the effects of light intensity, photoperiod and water temperature on the growth and surface bloom formation of blanket weed. These experiments combined underwater and surface photography to quantify change in algal area over time. The results demonstrated the existence of a minimum threshold of photoperiod and light intensity for bloom formation and substantial algal growth. Surface blooms did not occur when the photoperiod was too short, suggesting day length is a limiting factor. We also found that temperatures between 16-22 degrees Celsius were the thermal optimum for algae to form surface blooms, whilst the highest growth rate of algae on the sediment occurred at 14 degrees Celsius. With the increasing impact of climate change on freshwater ecosystems, these data will help predict the occurrence of surface blooms and assess which waterbodies could be under threat of blanket weed blooms in the future.",1,,6/5/23 10:30,6/5/23 12:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

OAE accelerates the natural rock weathering process by adding alkaline minerals directly into seawater. However, sudden alterations in seawater pH and alkalinity might shift the plankton community structure. Unfortunately, the impacts of OAE on marine ecosystems, especially zooplankton, are mostly unexplored. The present study assessed the direct (physiological stress) and indirect (changes in phytoplankton dynamics) effects of increased alkalinity and pH on the zooplankton community. Natural plankton communities were studied during two large-scale mesocosm experiments under simulated OAE conditions in a Norwegian fjord and at Helgoland roads in the North Sea. In the fjord, an alkalinity gradient from delta 0 to 600 µEql-1 was tested and a comparative analysis was conducted between calcium and silica mineral-based OAE set-ups. In contrast, only calcium-based mineral was used in Helgoland Road with a higher range of alkalinity levels, ranging from delta 0 to 1500 µEql-1 . We assessed the zooplankton community composition in both studies. The results were corroborated with laboratory experiments, using cosmopolitan copepod species Acartia tonsa¸ where no direct effects of increased alkalinity were observed, suggesting their relative resiliency toward altered OAE. Overall, our study emphasized the importance of a multitrophic study of marine communities to understand the potential ecological consequences of emerging techniques such as OAE.",4,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Water levels in the 24 mesocosms (1.9 m diameter, 1 m water depth, 0.2 m sediment depth) are maintained with groundwater, continuously mixed using mechanical paddles, and heated to treatment temperatures with submerged heating elements. Mesocosm temperatures are either ambient, ambient plus ~2 deg C, or ambient plus ~4 deg C, and mesocosms within each temperature group are further treated with low (groundwater only) or high nutrients (added NO3-N and PO4-P). During summer 2021, mixing paddles were turned off/on for 2-week periods. We collected water samples above and below thermoclines during no mixing, and depth-integrated water samples during mixing, for initial and post-24 h incubation dissolved O2 and N2 concentrations. In most cases, we observed PO4, NH4, and N2 accumulation in bottom waters during stratification, along with O2 consumption. N2 accumulation, presumably due to denitrification, and water column O2 respiration rates varied and were not predictable based on temperature or nutrient treatment. Sediment O2 consumption and bottom-water NH4 and PO4 accumulation were generally higher in elevated nutrient and temperature mesocosms, but variability was high. In general, results followed expected patterns commonly observed in stratified lakes and reinforce previous work showing that internal nutrient loading from lake sediments includes both N and P, both of which represent nutrient legacies that can delay water quality improvements after watershed nutrient loading reductions.",4,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Rulli,Mayra,mayra.rulli@nateko.lu.se,Brownification impacts on dissolved organic phosphorus bioavailability – a mesocosm study,"Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of stream and river waters can lead to the eutrophication of coastal ecosystems. While eutrophication in coastal waters is often a consequence of riverine loads of inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), these may also occur alongside increasing transports of coloured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (i.e., brownification). Browning may, in turn, lead to increased inputs of potentially bioavailable fractions of organic N and P. Yet, while inorganic nutrient dynamics have been extensively researched, it is unclear how the pool of bioavailable dissolved organic P (BDOP) responds to the individual and interactive effects of reduced light, increased DOC&nbsp;and inorganic nutrients. To address this issue, we conducted a fully factorial mesocosm experiment manipulating inorganic nutrient supply, labile carbon (C) concentration&nbsp;and water colour, and we carried out bioassays to estimate BDOP. Whereas we found no link between C and BDOP, we found that inorganic nutrient enrichment corresponded to increases in BDOP. There was an interaction effect of BDOP concentration with colour, indicating that inorganic nutrients only triggered BDOP accumulation in clear waters, whereas in dark waters, BDOP remained relatively constant. We argue that, in clear and nutrient-rich waters, the increased turnover and degradation of phytoplankton biomass may contribute to increasing BDOP concentrations. Therefore, continued brownification and eutrophication of coastal waters, is likely to decrease DOP concentrations that are bioavailable for the plankton communities.",2,,6/5/23 10:30,6/5/23 12:00,Auditorium Illes Balears,

Yet, despite its potential to enhance long-term carbon storage in ocean water as bicarbonate ions, and therefore to mitigate ocean acidification, little is known about its possible side effects and/or co-benefits on natural planktonic communities. To address this knowledge gap, a mesocosm experiment was carried out in the Taliarte Harbor, on Gran Canaria, Spain. Nine mesocosms were deployed and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equilibrated alkalinity gradient was applied in increments of 300 &amp;microEq &amp;#183 L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, from 2400 to 4800 &amp;microEq &amp;#183 L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This mesocosm study was the first attempt at evaluating OAE’s potential impacts &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;<em>.</em> The metabolic response of the microbial plankton community was monitored from mid-September to mid-October 2021. The results show that Net Community Production (NCP) and Gross Community Production (GCP) rates, as well as Community Respiration (CR) and metabolic balance (GP: R), did not present a linear response to the applied TA gradient. Yet, a non-significant optimum curve was observed in the form of a slight increase in all rates up to &amp;Delta1800 &amp;microEq &amp;#183 L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, followed by a drop.

These key species are clearly declining worldwide due to multiple anthropogenic and biotic pressures, such as habitat loss or climate change-related effects. These impacts are leading to local/regional extinctions of marine forests and increasing their populations' fragmentation and isolation. In the actual context of global climate change, discrete extreme temperature events in the ocean, known as marine heatwaves (MHWs), are rising as threats to marine boundaries in many areas of the planet. We analysed 74 years of daily sea surface temperature data on the occurrence of MHWs in the Cantabrian Sea (N Iberian Peninsula), finding a clear increase in their frequency, duration and intensity in the last 20 years. Also, we performed a 10-d mesocosm experiment to assess how MHWs affect synthetic fragmented and non-fragmented patches of <em>Ericaria selaginoides</em>. After this, those synthetic patches were deployed in a tidal rock pool during 10-d to detect effects on the recruitment of epifaunal assemblages. Mesocosm experiment results showed how<em> E. selaginoides</em> biomass, productivity and oxygen consumption significantly decreased as MHW intensity increased. Field deployment revealed that abundance, composition and structure of the epifaunal assemblages were significantly affected by the interaction of prior stress by MHWs and patch fragmentation.

This work studies the interaction between microplastics (MPs) and cadmium (Cd) or copper (Cu) on Mediterranean phytoplankton. To do so, natural communities were incubated at different concentrations of MP (0, 100, and 1000 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and metal (10, 100, and 1000 nM). Our results suggest a variable response ranging from enhanced toxicity to an apparent protective role on cell counts. MP deleteriously impacted larger phytoplankton (picoeukaryotes and nanophytoplankton) and enhanced picocyanobacteria proliferation. Cd and Cu elicited different responses. The addition of Cd had no effect on the community except on picocyanobacteria that benefited from low Cd levels. When Cd was combined with high concentrations of MPs, an increase in mortality of picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes was observed. Cu addition was detrimental for all groups, especially the larger ones. Surprisingly, adding environmental Cu concentrations combined with a very high MPs concentration increased the cell abundance of all phytoplankton groups, suggesting a positive interaction. At high MP concentrations, an apparent protective role in reducing the effect of Cu was observed for all groups except picocyanobacteria. In summary, MPs can alleviate Cu toxicity in the largest phytoplankton groups but exacerbate Cd toxicity in the smallest ones, generating a variable response dependent on concentrations and cell size.",0,509,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Results showed that media consumption rates change spatially and are largely driven by organic matter content, mud content, or mean grain size. This highlights the dependency of carbon degradation on the ambient sedimentary environment. Importantly, sedimentary environmental drivers were different for media with and without microplastic. Our results indicate that microplastic polyester fibers break ecosystem relationships and alter carbon cycling dynamics.

Additionally, statistical analysis showed that besides the time, the origin of the seawater inoculum and polymer type were the factors that had the most influence in shaping the microbial community attached to the polymer. Interestingly, UV-weathering was not found to have a significant effect on the community structure. Several of the detected genera encompass strains that were reported to have hydrocarbon or plastic degradation potential.

While MP exposure leads to increased photosynthetic efficiency of the coral-associated photosymbiont, its interaction with heterotrophic feeding, the second source of coral energy, is less well explored. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the responses of two reef-building coral species (Pocillopora verrucosa and Stylophora pistillata) ina six-week MP aquarium experiment with different feeding regimes: CF (twice-weekly feeding of the microplastic-free control group), MP + CF (400 ppl mix of MP types + control feeding), and MP + HF (400 ppl MP + high, daily feeding). To assess the interactive effects of MP and feeding regime, we measured coral growth, photosynthetic efficiency, and photosynthesis and respiration rates. Surprisingly,&nbsp; coral growth was similar under all feeding and microplastic treatments. However, high feeding modulated the effects of MP on the photosymbiont of Pocillopora verrucosa, with increased photosynthetic efficiency and respiration in the MP + CF treatment compared to the other treatments. In contrast, Stylophora pistillata was not affected by MP exposure alone, but when combined with high feeding photosynthetic efficiency decreased. This decrease could be explained by an increase in their heterotrophic activity. These findings highlight that the feeding regime has an effect on the corals response to MP.

In these systems algae use polluting nutrients to grow, thereby cleaning wastewater while producing biomass to be used for biofuel or fertilizer. However, wastewater-algal cultivation has not yet been widely adopted, one reason being that herbivorous zooplankton often proliferate and reduce algal yields. Biological control is a promising solution to this problem, but few studies have tested methods of biological control to improve algal yields. To test whether bluegill sunfish can improve the performance of wastewater-algal cultivation systems, we built 18 225-L raceway ponds with continuous circulation. We filled the ponds with ammonium-rich hypereutrophic media intended to imitate wastewater, inoculated them with local phytoplankton and zooplankton, and performed 12.5% media exchanges every two days to imitate a continuous culturing system. We placed one juvenile bluegill (<em>Lepomis macrochirus</em>) in each of 12 ponds, half inside a 0.1-m<sup>2</sup> cage meant to reduce predation rates on more mobile prey and half outside the cage. The remaining six ponds served as fishless controls.

These “newborn” lakes receive solute-rich meltwater, yet little is known about their physical (i.e., turbidity from glacial flour) and biogeochemical conditions across a range of glacial influence. We surveyed alpine lakes fed by both glacial and snowpack meltwaters and those fed by snowpack alone to compare nutrient concentrations, stoichiometry, water clarity, chlorophyll, and zooplankton communities across elevational gradients. Total phosphorus and nitrate concentrations were two and three times higher in glacial lakes than in non-glacial lakes, respectively. Despite increased nutrient concentrations, total organic carbon concentrations in glacial lakes were two times lower than in non-glacial lakes, likely due to reduced primary production caused by low water clarity from glacial flour. The carbon to phosphorus ratio and the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of lake seston increased with water clarity in glacial lakes, suggesting that turbidity from glacial flour increases light limitation and increases stoichiometric food quality for zooplankton in newborn lakes. However, chlorophyll-a concentrations did not differ between lake types. Through piecewise structural equation modeling we found that glaciers exhibit a bidirectional control on nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations mediated through landscape NDVI and lake clarity. In addition, zooplankton communities in high-turbidity glacial lakes comprised cyclopoid copepods and rotifers (i.e., non-filter feeders), while non-glacial lakes tended to be dominated by calanoid copepods and cladocerans (i.e., filter feeders).

We used a comparative experimental approach to develop and test hypotheses of how epilithic algal communities in meltwater streams respond to glacier loss. In August 2022, we surveyed epilithic communities and their meltwater environments across a gradient of deglacialization in the Canadian Rockies, a region predicted to lose substantial glacial coverage in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Communities exposed to high glacial input consisted mainly of diatoms and the chrysophyte <em>Hydrurus foetidus</em>. In contrast, green algae and cyanobacteria were more abundant under conditions of low glacial influence. Surprisingly, a unimodal rather than negative linear relationship best explained epilithic algal biomass as a function of increased glacial influence. Therefore, we hypothesized that the highest algal growth would occur at intermediate levels of meltwater turbidity.&nbsp; To test this hypothesis, we inoculated 20 experimental stream mesocosms with epilithic biofilms taken from a clear glacial stream and tested four levels of meltwater turbidity and a clear control on biofilm biomass over four weeks in Fall 2022. Here, turbidity treatments were created by mixing clear meltwater from the lowest glacial influence site and glacial flour, a determinant of meltwater turbidity. Chlorophyll<em> a</em> concentrations were again highest at intermediate levels of turbidity. We hypothesize that increased photoinhibition limits the development of epilithic biofilms in increasingly clear meltwaters. These findings highlight the importance of meltwater turbidity in regulating the productive capacity of downstream ecosystems, and how alpine streams might become less productive in the absence of glacial meltwater inputs.",1,,6/9/23 15:00,6/9/23 16:30,Sala Portixol 1,

For the past 6 years we have sampled the zooplankton communities and abiotic parameters of 18 high-alpine lakes in the Hohe Tauern national park in central Austria. The lakes encompass a wide range of size, altitude, maximum depth, age and accessibility. Microclimate is a dominant driver of the annual temperature cycle, with long-term trends only now emerging. Zooplankton communities show high beta diversity, with many species only occurring in a single lake. Both morphological and molecular data show that lakes in close geographic proximity are very different from another, with only water bodies with direct physical connections to one another being similar in their diversity. However, over the period of the study, dissimilarity appears to be declining, at least in terms of zooplankton morphological diversity. &nbsp;There is also evidence that colonization by new species has the potential to have community-level effects.&nbsp; Several of the lakes have deep chlorophyll maxima with at times remarkably high chlorophyll values, albeit with high interannual variability. However, with logistical restraints limiting sampling to one date per year, the degree of intra-annual variability in the chlorophyll and zooplankton data remains unexplored. These data provide a baseline to measure the impending changes in high alpine aquatic communities brought on by climate change.",4,528,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The streams draining these landscapes are affected by these shifts, integrating hydrologic, geologic, and biological signals across the catchment. We examined the organic and inorganic carbon dynamics of streams in four Alpine catchments in Switzerland to assess how glacier loss and vegetation expansion are affecting the carbon cycle of these high mountain ecosystems. We find that organic carbon concentration and humic-like fluorescence properties increase with vegetation cover, implying an increasing importance of allochthonous carbon sources following glacier retreat. Meanwhile, streams transitioned from carbon dioxide sinks to sources with decreasing glacier coverage and increased vegetation coverage, with chemical weathering and soil respiration likely determining the balance. Carbon dioxide undersaturation was observed in glaciated and non-glaciated streams, indicating geochemical consumption could be more widespread in high-mountain, minimally vegetated catchments than previously described. Our results demonstrate significant shifts in organic and inorganic carbon dynamics of alpine streams following glacier recession. The clear link between the terrestrial and aquatic zones further emphasizes the coupled dynamics with which all hydrologic and biogeochemical changes in these ecosystems should be considered, including the carbon sink or source potential of montane ecosystems.",1,526,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Lakes differ in their glacial connectivity and in their turbidity due to glacial particles. Lake Ventisquero Negro is a recently formed proglacial lake and it is still in contact with the glacier. Lakes Mascardi and Frías lost their glacial connectivity during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Total dissolved solid concentration has a significant contribution to the environmental gradient determining the segregation of the three lakes. The net relatedness index (NRI) showed that the bacterial community of lake Ventisquero Negro is determined by environmental filtering, while in the other lakes, species interaction would be a more important driver. The co-occurrence network analysis showed an increase in modularity and in the number of modules when comparing Lake Ventisquero Negro with the two large glacier-fed lakes suggesting an increase in heterogeneity.&nbsp; At the same time, the presence of modules with phototrophic bacteria (Cyanobium strains) in lakes Frías and Mascardi would reflect the increase of this functional photosynthetic association.&nbsp; Overall, our results showed that the reduction in ice masses in Patagonia will affect downstream large deep piedmont lakes losing the glacial influence in their bacterial communities.",2,,6/9/23 15:00,6/9/23 16:30,Sala Portixol 1,

INSIGHTS FROM THE FIRST NINE YEARS OF THE TETON ALPINE STREAM PROJECT,"Climate change is dramatically altering headwater ecosystems, primarily through the recession of mountain glaciers and snowpack. In 2015, we set out to understand how snow and ice recession translates to impacts for ecosystems and biodiversity through a long-term monitoring study. We focused on the Teton Range of western North America where a small but mighty group of mountain glaciers were persisting but would likely disappear in the coming decades. Our plan was simple: we would identify representative headwater streams to monitor annually for as long as our careers (and bodies!) would allow. It took a couple of years to find our groove, but we soon settled on a basic monitoring protocol and 12 core streams that we would study for the long haul. Our protocol includes quantitative invertebrate sampling, microbial data collection, in situ temperature loggers, and a suite of other abiotic and geochemical data. Our 12 streams span a gradient of hydrological sources including glacier, snowfields, and rock glaciers. The latter category—rock glaciers—is particularly interesting as geological theory suggests that these debris-covered ice masses will persist on the landscape longer than their “surface ice” counterparts and thus could represent key climate refugia. Since our study began, one stonefly in the Teton headwaters—Zapada glacier—has been listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

The degree to which mountain stream processes influence nearshore lake productivity as a function of their seasonal flow regimes remains unclear. To investigate how seasonal variation in stream flow and in-stream metabolic and nitrogen uptake rates covary with nearshore lake productivity, we continuously monitored dissolved oxygen, temperature, stream specific conductance (SPC) and collected surface and pore water samples for nutrient concentrations in streams and around the outlets and the nearshore of Lake Tahoe (California‐Nevada, United States of America), in two watersheds with differing flow regimes. We found that nearshore net ecosystem production (NEP) was negatively correlated with the magnitude of daily streamflow&nbsp;(β<sub>flow</sub>:&nbsp; -0.618 ± 0.069, p&lt; 0.001, r<sup>2c&nbsp;</sup>= 0.112) and positively correlated daily SPC (β<sub>SPC</sub>:&nbsp; 5.64 ± 0.327, p&lt; 0.001, r<sup>2c&nbsp;</sup>= 0.291). These patterns were particularly pronounced for the west shore of Lake Tahoe which has a greater amount of annual precipitation relative to the drier east shore. The positive and negative relationships between modeled nearshore NEP, SPC and streamflow, suggest that nearshore metabolism may be more related to changes in groundwater inputs relative to surface water. Observed patterns in autotrophic production indicate that precipitation accumulation in mountain watersheds can control the physical stream processes (streamflow, timing of baseflow, and water temperature) which may influence NEP immediately near stream outlets.",2,525,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Climate models predict an even more extreme future, with sustained periods of drought punctuated by intense precipitation events. Communities' response to this variation depends on local environmental or ecological context. To test the relative sensitivity of lake communities to interannual environmental variability, we analyzed nine years of zooplankton and limnological data from 70 lakes in the California Sierra Nevada. Tremendous interannual environmental variation occurred in the study period, encompassing both the driest and one of the wettest years on record. Precipitation largely fell as snow and impacted water temperature – wet years had colder summer water temperatures at high elevations and warmer temperatures at low elevations compared to drier years (ANCOVA, p=0.003). Water transparency was reduced, and zooplankton abundance increased in wet years compared to drier years (Secchi depth, p=0.002; abundance, p=0.006). Zooplankton community composition turnover across elevation was similar among all years, though there was a tendency for greater spatial turnover in wet years (LME, p=0.2). Finally, zooplankton communities showed greater temporal turnover in lakes at high elevations (p=0.01).

However, warming has disrupted the stability of this unique habitat, as evidenced by the first recorded ice off events that occurred on Ward Hunt Lake (83N) in 2011. Microbial assemblages in perennial lake ice are therefore especially vulnerable to further warming in the Arctic, and since little is known on how lake ice microbes contribute to energy cycling in freshwater systems, it is unclear how they will adapt to variable seasonal ice conditions. Our objective is to describe the microbial assemblages of Ward Hunt Lake ice. Ice cores were collected in July 2022, from which we extracted nucleic acids for next-generation sequencing. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed the presence of a diverse bacterial community including Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Actinobacteriota and Cyanobacteria which varied in composition by ice strata, and differed from the underlying water column. Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing was also used to investigate the functional and metabolic potential of microbes, with special attention to pathways associated with psychrophily, including nutrient utilization (oligotrophy), cold-shock proteins (cold), and genome repair (UV resistance).

Moreover, alpine lakes respond faster to changes in their catchments than low altitude lakes due to their small size, small catchment areas, and steep surrounding slopes. With accelerated changes in mountain climate, mountain lakes have become of increasing interest to scientists as predictors of changes in low altitude lakes. However, traditional one-dimensional models based solely on meteorologic conditions fail to represent alpine lake temperature cycles reliably. In contrast to low altitude lakes, energy balances in mountain lakes are highly impacted by catchment properties such as snow cover and inflow rather than direct fluxes with the atmosphere. An additional practical challenge comes from the lack of accessibility and harsh field conditions of these lakes. The evolution of mountain lakes in a changing climate is thus still unknown. This study quantifies the role of throughflow in the heat budget in various Alpine lakes in the French alps spanning from 2000 m to 3000 m a.s.l, in glacial and non-glacial watersheds using meteorological and water temperature data collected in the “Reseaux Sentinelle” Lakes in France.

These processes are primarily linked to the decoupling of production and respiration of organic matter in time and/or space, whereas warming and increasing CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere are generally of secondary importance. Metabolic imbalance from spatial and temporal decoupling of production and respiration in coastal ecosystems, most pronounced in stratified and high-latitude systems, can lead to large variability in pH and oxygen on seasonal and long-term scales. Inputs of freshwater, nutrients, and organic matter from land, typically resulting from human activities in the watershed, are main drivers of long-term trends. Enhanced nutrient input from land, stimulating ecosystem productivity and thus raising pH levels, can counteract acidification in shallow and well-mixed coastal systems, whereas eutrophication and acidification are synergistic pressures in stratified systems where bottom waters may display both low pH and low O<sub>2</sub>. Coastal oligotrophication resulting from nutrient management can amplify the effect of rising CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere on pH in the euphotic zone but may also alleviate acidification in bottom waters of stratified systems.

We discovered a 3- to 5-fold decline in boron (as B:Ca) in otoliths of eastern Baltic Sea cod (EBC) between the late 1990s and 2021. B:Ca is positively proportional to pH in carbonates, as B in the form of borate is taken up in the CaCO<sub>3</sub> matrix. Examining a time series of EBC otoliths, we found varying levels of B:Ca since the 1980s, with the most recent years at an all-time low during this period. This trend correlates with declines in pH and dissolved oxygen, but not with changes in salinity. We examined possible physiological influences on B:Ca by including a collection of healthy Icelandic cod as an out-group. Icelandic cod otoliths showed strongly positive correlations of B:Ca with physiologically regulated P:Ca; this was not the case for EBC. Finally, B:Ca in EBC otoliths is anti-correlated to some extent with Mn:Mg, a proposed proxy for hypoxia exposure. This inverse relationship is hypothesized to reflect the dual phenomena of hypoxia and acidification as a result of decomposition of large algal blooms.&nbsp; Taken together, the otolith biomarkers suggest a general increase in both hypoxia and acidification within the Baltic in the last decade.",2,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza A,

Increasing anthropogenic impacts on the watershed has&nbsp;led to a doubling of riverine nutrient loading since the 1950s, leading to widespread eutrophication in estuarine and coastal waters. Excessive nutrient loading stimulates primary production in the surface euphotic layer which consumes CO<sub>2</sub> and elevates pH, but unconsumed organic matter sinks and decomposes in bottom waters, producing CO<sub>2</sub><sup> </sup>and reducing pH. In the meantime, accelerated chemical weathering from acid-rain and mine drainage, agricultural liming and urban impervious surfaces, and other anthropogenic changes in watersheds have resulted in alkalinization in many rivers. To discern how these environmental drivers influence long-term pH trends in coastal waters, a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical-carbonate chemistry model was used to conduct hindcast simulations of Chesapeake Bay between 1950 and 2010. The model reproduced the observed chlorophyll increase and hypoxia expansion due to the increased nutrient loading beginning in the 1970s and continuing to the present. In contrast, low-pH bottom waters and acidic volume showed complex changes without significant long-term trends. Generalized Additive Model analysis of long-term pH trends in different regions of Chesapeake Bay revealed increasing pH in the upper Bay driven by the river alkalinization, no significant pH trends in the mid-Bay, and decreasing pH in the lower Bay driven by ocean acidification. Scenario runs were performed to assess the individual effects of rising <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub>, river alkalinization and riverine nutrient loading on long-term pH changes in Chesapeake Bay. The model results suggest that river alkalinization was as important as ocean acidification in driving the long-term pH changes in the estuary.

In Lake Geneva, the deep hypolimnion can become hypoxic. However, the hydrodynamics of the deep hypolimnion are not well understood, since at present, they are mainly based on data from a single monitoring station located in the deepest part of the lake (309 m; SHL2; Figure 1). Lake Geneva is composed of two basins: the narrow, shallow <em>Petit Lac</em> and the large, deep <em>Grand Lac</em>. During cold winters, the <em>Petit Lac</em> cools much faster and its dense, oxygen rich, cold waters flow into the deep hypolimnion of the <em>Grand Lac,</em> which allows re-oxygenation of its oxygen poor waters. In order to quantify the amount of oxygen flowing into the <em>Grand Lac</em>, the three-dimensional MITgcm model was calibrated to simulate dissolved oxygen dynamics during the exceptionally cold winter of 2012. For the simulation, three different lake areas were considered: (i) the whole lake, (ii) only the <em>Grand Lac</em> basin, and (iii) the coastal zones of the whole lake. We quantified the contribution of oxygen originating from the <em>Petit Lac</em> and from the coastal zones, and demonstrated that the main source of oxygen renewal in the deep hypolimnion of the <em>Grand Lac</em> was water that came from the <em>Petit Lac</em>. During winter 2012, complete water overturning due to convective cooling did not occur in the <em>Grand Lac</em>. Therefore, the flow of cold, oxygen rich <em>Petit Lac</em> waters makes a significant contribution to the oxygen budget of the deep <em>Grand Lac</em> hypolimnion and can thus improve the water quality of this layer.

Although the hypoxia area has been expanding in recent years, it remains unclear how severe the hypoxia develops during past decades and what are human and climate contribution to the variation of it. Therefore, a comprehensive index is helpful to quantify the severity of the hypoxia in terms of multiple observable properties, such as volume , thickness, longitude span etc.. On the other hand, the contribution of direct and indirect factors is also helpful to be quantified for better understanding the influencing pathways and relative importance of human activities and climate change. In this study we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) of the observable characteristics of hypoxic events in the Gulf of Mexico during summer 1985-2014 and defined the first principal component as the Hypoxia Index (HI). The thickness and longitude span are decreasing, while bottom average DO, area and volume are increasing. Then the severity in terms of HI showed a slowly alleviating trend of 0.01 yr­<sup>-1</sup>. Then, we attribute three direct hypoxia drivers--- residence time, stratification and solubility@(T, S), ---as climate change-originated, and one other direct hypoxia driver---respiration---as human activities-originated. Multi-regression analysis showed that these four direct drivers explained 50% of the total variation of HI. Moreover, using a coupling model in this half variation, we revealed that climate change contributes 65% and human 35 % to the nGOM hypoxia variation during 1985-2014. The quota for the four direct drivers are 8% for DO solubility, 35% for respiration, 18% for residence time, 39% for stratification, respectively. Our model suggests reducing respiration and stratification are the two major pathways for alleviating hypoxia in nGOM under the fast-changing climate background.",3,531,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The size and distribution of the hypoxic bottom waters in the nGOM have been well documented by the yearly summer hypoxia survey cruises since 1985, while little is known about the long-term changes in bottom water pH. In this study, we reconstructed the pH evolution of the bottom water in the nGOM from 1985 to 2017 by considering the biogeochemical pH changes (DpH<sub>aerobic</sub> and DpH<sub>anaerobic</sub> resulting from aerobic and anaerobic processes respectively) superimposed on the mixing-induced pH background (pH<sub>mix</sub> estimated from a four end-member mixing model and the atmospheric <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> history). The estimated pH agreed well (0.01 ± 0.05) with the high-precision spectrophotometric pH measurements which were available in recent years. The mixing-induced pH baseline (pH<sub>mix</sub>) of the bottom water showed a long-term decreasing trend with a rate of -0.0027 yr<sup>-1</sup> which mainly resulting from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> invasion (-0.0022 yr<sup>-1</sup>). Our results show that eutrophication-related aerobic respiration (DpH<sub>aerobic</sub>) dominantly controlled the spatial pattern and size of bottom acidification in the nGOM. As a result, bottom acidification showed similar spatial distribution with that of hypoxia in each year with low pH values resulting from the aerobic decomposition of organic matters. The size of acidification area (where pH&lt;7.8) displayed substantial year-to-year variability ranging from 1120 to 26650 km<sup>2</sup> with a 30-year average of 13700 km<sup>2</sup>, which was highly correlated to that of the hypoxia area size.

Emergent aquatic insects serve as sources of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) for aquatic predators like fish as well as a diversity of terrestrial predators ranging from birds to bats. We have previously demonstrated that emergent aquatic insects are uniquely rich in n-3 LCPUFA compared to terrestrial insects and that the breeding success of some insectivorous predators depends on the availability of aquatic insects as high-quality subsidies. While in-depth research on the importance of these interactions is only just beginning, anthropogenic pressures like climate and land use change are already altering the quantity, nutritional quality, and phenology of aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidies through multiple mechanisms. For example, our research shows that while insect biodiversity loss due to land use change in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems is associated with lower insect biomass, declines in aquatic biodiversity lead to much greater losses of n-3 LCPUFA compared to equivalent losses of species richness in terrestrial ecosystems. We also find that the timing of n-3 LCPUFA subsidies from emergent aquatic insects is rapidly shifting due to climate change, outpacing rates of phenological advancement in insectivorous birds and resulting in phenological nutritional mismatches in riparian food webs for these ephemeral compounds. Overall, our findings highlight the outsized importance of conserving aquatic biodiversity for maintaining cross-ecosystem functions as well as the need to understand how global change processes are interactively altering aquatic subsidies.",2,535,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

An important ecosystem service likely affected by this increasing intermittency is the export of resources rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), from aquatic to terrestrial systems. Here, we investigated how flow intermittency affected EPA transfer to riparian spiders along 9 headwater streams of an alpine catchment (Val Roseg, Switzerland) with different degrees of intermittency. We used fatty acid analysis to test if there were differences in fatty acid content in spiders sampled along streams varying in degree of intermittency. In addition, we used compound-specific isotope analysis (<sup>2</sup>H-CSIA) to determine the origin of different fatty acids present in spiders. We found a higher content of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA, stearidonic acid (SDA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), but a lower α-linolenic acid (ALA) content in spiders collected along perennial streams compared to periodically intermittent streams. However, spiders from seasonally drying streams showed similar fatty acid mass fractions as spiders from perennial streams. d<sup>2</sup>H values indicated that fatty acid sources also differed between streams varying in intermittency.

Agricultural land use is a primary cause for lost or impaired connectivity in stream-riparian systems. Here we assessed the role of forested buffers in mitigating the effects of agricultural land use on streams and riparian (spider) food webs using a paired-reach approach, with upstream reaches lacking woody riparian vegetation and downstream reaches having well-developed forested buffers. Richness of emerged insects captured on sticky traps differed between reach types and with season. Dipterans (Chironomidae) and beetles were more abundant at unbuffered reaches with emergence peaks in spring, whilst disturbance sensitive EPT taxa were more abundant at forested reaches and had emergence peaks in summer and autumn. Spider assemblages correlated with both riparian characteristics and the emergence of aquatic insects. Partial redundancy analysis showed that variation in spider composition was explained by aquatic insect composition and emergence.

We investigated the feeding ecology of four co-occurring anurans in a small South African river using several approaches (stomach content, stable isotope and fatty acid analyses), with the aims of determining diet compositions and the relative contributions of aquatic- versus terrestrial-derived resources to the anuran diets. We collected anurans in 2012 and 2013 at an upstream and a downstream site in the river. The proportions of aquatic-derived fatty acids were generally higher in tadpoles and a predominantly aquatic species of frog (<em>Xenopus laevis</em>), lower in the semi-aquatic species (<em>Strongylopus grayii</em> and <em>Amietia fuscigula</em>), and lowest in a toad that favours terrestrial habitats (<em>Sclerophyrs capensis</em>) at both sites. Stomach analysis of adult specimens confirmed that <em>X. laevis</em> had recently ingested only aquatic prey, <em>S. grayii</em> and <em>A. fuscigula</em> recently ingested combinations of aquatic and terrestrial prey, and <em>Sc. capensis</em> ingested primarily terrestrial prey. Stable isotope models indicated some differential contributions of aquatic vs terrestrial resources to the species at the different sites.

Terrestrial pulses can generate many changes over lentic systems, such as the benthic-pelagic coupling – and variations in intrinsic parameters of these perturbations can lead to different responses from the recipient ecosystem. However, a knowledge gap remains in the understanding of the consequences of the variations of allochthonous pulses on the structure and the functioning of lentic aquatic ecosystems.

Aquatic insects contain higher LC-PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), arachidonic acid (ARA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), than terrestrial insects. The importance of LC-PUFA has been demonstrated for several riparian predators (e.g., birds, bats, and spiders), thus the penetration of aquatic insects into terrestrial habitats strongly dictates the availability of these LC-PUFA in terrestrial food webs. We deployed Malaise/window hybrid traps at 8 different distances (ranging from 1 to 1000 m) from the lake shore in two different terrestrial habitats (i.e., forested and meadows) to estimate the terrestrial penetration of aquatic biomass and LC-PUFA (i.e., EPA, ARA, DHA). Terrestrial insect biomass generally did not differ with distance from the lake, but aquatic biomass decreased with distance from lake shore in both habitats at differing rates. Our dataset provides order-level aquatic and terrestrial insect abundance along a distance gradient and demonstrates that physiologically-important aquatic-derived LC-PUFA are only available for terrestrial predators within a few meters of a lakeshore, highlighting the importance of riparian zones for terrestrial food webs.",4,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

Nevertheless, since this approach heavily relies on the physiological discrimination towards the heavier isotope and its bioavailability, it is susceptible to the influence of local environmental processes. This is particularly relevant in regions affected by large nutrient inputs (e.g. upwelling areas). Our study focuses on the role played by a set of six MPAs along the western Iberian Peninsula, the uppermost region of the Canary upwelling system. Low trophic guilds (particulate organic matter, zooplankton, filter feeders, omnivores and first consumers) samples were processed for &amp;delta&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &amp;delta&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N at 9 locations inside and 7 locations outside MPAs. Our results indicate a very limited influence of selected MPAs with a major role played by upwelling index and Chl-<em>a</em> concentration. These results are particularly relevant for conservation and fisheries management suggesting that nutrient availability in upwelling regions may blur MPAs’ effects on trophic levels and food webs.

Stable isotope and gut content analysis show these terrestrial subsidies are incorporated into the river food web through direct consumption by aquatic macroinvertebrates and fishes. We used sticky traps to measure the transport of subsidies back into the riparian zone via emerging insects along a gradient of terrestrial inputs. Mean aquatic insect emergence doubled along a gradient from no wildlife to high wildlife input, and the proportion of total insects comprised by aquatic taxa increased from 36% to 58%. The increase was non-linear and was most pronounced at the lower two sites, with emergent aquatic insects up to an order of magnitude higher at the furthest downstream versus upstream site. Differences in emergence rates among sites varied by taxa. Diptera emergence was relatively consistent among sites; Plecoptera emergence peaked at intermediate sites; and Trichoptera and particularly Ephemeroptera were significantly greater at the most downstream sites.

In lack of a photosynthetic apparatus, NCDs must acquire carbon and energy from external sources of organic matter to meet their physiological needs, still their interaction with organic matter remains unclear.

We provide the first comprehensive inventory of TEP from the ocean surface to a depth of 4000 meters in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, evaluating its contribution to carbon export and sequestration into the deep ocean. Results indicate that TEP concentration is primarily determined by primary production, with higher concentrations located above the deep chlorophyll maxima. In the deep ocean, TEP concentrations are lower yet mirror the concentrations in the surface, demonstrating the significance of TEP sinking below both the export compartment (2.8 Pg C yr-1; 27% of total POC flux at 200 m) and the sequestration compartment (0.8 Pg C yr-1; 36% of total POC flux at 1000 m). In situ incubation experiments conducted across ocean basins indicate short TEP residence times, averaging 27 and 333 days in the export and sequestration compartments, respectively.

To identify relevant drivers of sediment P buffering and, thus, potential P release, we investigated the effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, extracellular enzyme activity, and metabolic diversity in hydrologically connected and disconnected floodplain lakes from the main river Elbe (Magdeburg, Germany). DOM quality correlated positively with enzyme activities associated with carbon degradation, the mineralisation of organic P and nitrogen compounds, and partially with metabolic diversity. Enzyme activity, metabolic diversity, and DOM quality together explained ~ 90 % of the variation in P buffering, indicating a synergistic effect. Preliminary results furthermore showed that the hydrological connectivity between floodplain lakes and the river only had a minor effect. Our findings highlight that DOM quality and organic matter mineralisation drive P buffering and thus may amplify internal eutrophication. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of microbe-organic matter interactions for the P cycle in river-floodplain systems.",3,547,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Previous work has shown that particulate organic carbon (POC) in boreal inland waters experiences rapid decay compared to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Particles are important sites for enzymatic degradation in the marine pelagic zone and freshwater fjords. Enzymatic activity is a rate limiting step in organic matter decomposition. Determining how particle formation impacts enzyme activity in freshwater systems improves our understanding of the mechanisms driving mineralization along the freshwater continuum. In this study we assess the importance of particle formation for enzymatic degradation and carbon mineralization along an inland water continuum that includes peat pore water, a first order stream, and a lake in each of two peatland dominated, Swedish catchments. We assessed initial DOC and POC concentrations and baseline kinetics of enzymatic degradation associated with these pools. Samples were then separated into two treatments and incubated under dark conditions at 20°C for one month. One treatment involved continuous rolling to induce mechanical flocculation and the second remained static. Mineralization rates were measured throughout the incubation by tracking headspace CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.

This mechanism, known as the “priming effect” (PE), is well documented in soils but contradictory results have been reported in aquatic ecosystems. Here, incubation experiments were performed with various sources of NLDOM and LDOM in microcosms amended with nutrients and a microbial inoculum. A significant positive PE (~20% of initial NLDOM) was measured, but only with mixed or complex LDOM. Regardless of the LDOM, no PE was measured with highly recalcitrant NLDOM, when the LDOM/NLDOM ratio was low (0.3 vs 1) and when the NLDOM and microbial inoculum had the same origin (no mixing). The presence of sediments likely enhances microbial diversity and NLDOM degradation rate, but it did not increase the PE. Microbial use of LDOM was always associated with the production of new microbial NLDOM. Thus, accurate PE measurements require to discriminate this new microbial NLDOM from initial NLDOM. This was done here by stable isotope analysis of DOC. The PE was temporary and lasted about 2 weeks after LDOM addition. However, in areas with frequent additions of LDOM, a long-lasting PE is expected and may significantly increase CO<sub>2</sub> production. The mixing effect, occurring when refractory DOM is exposed to new conditions, seems to exert a strong control on its dynamics. Here, the addition of a new microbial inoculum had a stronger effect than adding LDOM or the PE.",5,545,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The objective of this experiment was to study the effects of drought on the decomposition of woody material in a hypersaline context. Woody stems of <em>Sarcocornia fruticosa</em> were either permanently placed at the floodplain (Dry treatment, D), submerged in the stream (Wet treatment, W), or temporarily submerged and then emerged at the floodplain (Wet-Dry treatment, WD), at the Rambla Salada watershed (Murcia, Spain), for 9 months. Extracellular enzyme activities as well as microbial biomass and diversity were analyzed altogether with weight loss. D stems presented higher fungal than bacterial biomass and higher hydrolytic enzyme activities, while in opposite, W stems presented higher bacterial biomass together with higher phenol oxidase activity. Microbial diversity showed significant differences between treatments although weight loss of D stems did not differ from the W ones. The WD stems had the lowest weight loss and a great change in the fungal biomass and diversity after the stems were placed on the floodplain. Results suggest a distinct degradation path for the W versus the D conditions and a severe impact to the microbial decomposition for the WD conditions. Furthermore, other environmental factors may play a role, such as a photodegradation enhancing decomposition (mainly in D) and high salinity inhibiting decomposition (mainly in W).",7,540,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Prokaryote viability, NEP, and DOM quality indices were significantly correlated with the distribution of the lakes according to their EEA, but not all of these variables were correlated with salinity.

We grew a 6-species bacterial community for one month on DOM isolated from eight environmental sources and tracked changes in the bacterial species abundances and DOM composition at five time points using 16S sequencing and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry. The molecular composition of the DOM shifted similarly over time among sources, despite different initial starting compositions.

However, they are often treated as distinct entities, separated operationally by size (0.7µm). We studied the dynamics of DOM and POM in an Arctic fjord between September 2020 and August 2021. Surface water was filtered through a GF/F filter (0.7 µm), while another part was unfiltered, and then rotated for 36h. Samples for dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations (DOC, POC), DOM composition, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and flow cytometry were taken before and after the incubation. From April to September, POC concentrations increased in both, filtered and unfiltered treatments by a factor of 0.04 - 1.5, while the lability of DOM decreased. Contrary to the measurements in the field, POC concentrations in the filtered water before the incubation were highest in the winter months and decreased in both treatments by 0.1 - 0.6, while the DOM composition indicated a transformation of recalcitrant to labile DOM. In both scenarios, EPS and bacterial activity increased. We confirm that during productive phases, POM can be replenished by the DOM pool through aggregation. However, POM dissolution, DOM transformation and increased bacterial activity during winter suggest that organic matter could be altered by bacteria into more labile material when new production is limited.

To understand carbon pool interplays we assessed carbon concentrations and chemical features, with particles separated into suspended and sinking particles as sinking velocity determines carbon fate even in turbulent systems. Unexpectedly, no particle microbiome differences could be detected between suspended and sinking particles. Seasonal dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics were primarily driven by humicity and aromaticity, with Autumn the least aromatic and Winter the most aromatic. This could be attributed to microbial respiration differences, with Autumn the minimum, and Winter the maximum. A significant correlation between the terrestrial- and marine-like humic material and particulate inorganic carbon values suggests that correlations with suspended and sinking particulate carbon concentrations help identify particle source, production, and/or degradation products. Overall, we show that although no significant sinking and suspended particle characteristics differences were identified, their separation could still provide useful policy information on carbon source aromaticity and lability, and blue carbon sequestration.",10,549,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In this study, we aim to highlight the effects of the addition of different DOM sources on the activity and structure of marine and fjord bacterial communities in the Arctic. tDOM isolated from Svalbard permafrost soil and pDOM from Diatom exudates was added to water sampled from an Arctic fjord (Isfjorden, Svalbard) and from the Northern Barents Sea (79.8 N and 33.7 E) in August 2019.

While starting communities where similar, responses were very distinct in fjord and marine waters. Bacterial abundance and production increased in both environments over the incubation period, but were 10-fold higher in fjord incubations. This higher productivity was accompanied with a large shift in community composition, mainly driven by the increase of Glaciecola&nbsp;(Gammaproteobacteria). In the marine community, Polaribacter&nbsp;(Flavobacteriia) increased most in abundance. In both environments, the combined addition of pDOM and tDOM gave the strongest response in terms of bacterial abundance and productivity.

However, when rapid and extreme events of temperature change are considered, the phytoplankton adaptive capacity breaks down in a number of our scenarios in which primary productivity plummets as a result.

Indeed, Ecopath mass-balanced models are widely-used tools to address various challenges in the understanding and protection of ecosystems. The model is composed of 68 functional groups, including 6 primary producers, discards and detritus, 27 invertebrate groups, 31 fish groups, dolphins and seabirds.&nbsp; New datasets were taken into account for biomasses, as well as for diets. Model results highlight a food web diagram, ranging over 5 trophic levels and placing <em>Prionace glauca, Squalus acanthias </em>and dolphins as top predators. The flux analysis shows that a major part of the flows occurs at trophic level 2 with 35.1% of the model total throughput and 43.8% of the total biomass. The catches have a mean trophic level of 3.47, higher than in previous studies, reflecting the diversification of the fisheries activities toward demersal species after the collapse of the sardina and anchovy stocks. The changes induced by the 2008 ecosystem shift on the GoL are discussed.",4,557,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Assembly processes can be understood as a set of filters acting at different spatio-temporal scales that jointly define the structure and composition of communities. Here, we explore the underlying assembly processes shaping marine fish species distribution and composition, using the heavily exploited North Sea. Our aims are to study (i) the relative importance of the different assembly processes shaping marine fish communities, (ii) the key environmental drivers determining species distributions and composition, and to (iii) quantify the role of traits in determining species niches and responses to the environment. Specifically, we fit a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM) using 31 years of standardized scientific bottom trawl survey data for 67 fish species. We use a set of environmental variables and species’ traits representing morphology, life history, reproduction and diet, while also accounting for phylogenetic relationships of species. Environmental variables, primarily related to temperature, explained over one third of the variance in species occurrence, while spatial effects explained half of the variability across species. This shows that environmental filtering and spatially-structured processes are the main drivers shaping the community assembly. Furthermore, among the total variance of individual species occurrences, 12.5% could be explained by traits, which improve the mechanistic understanding on species responses to environmental change. Hence, model predictions from JSDMs accounting for traits, environmental niches and potential interactions among multiple species can provide relevant simulations and forecasts with the potential to inform spatial management and conservation efforts aiming to preserve biodiversity and its associated services vital for human well-being.",1,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,

We studied these complex relationships using differently structured tritrophic food web models allowing for trait variation and thus eco-evolutionary and biomass-trait feedbacks at one, two or all trophic levels. A high functional diversity generally enhanced compensatory dynamics within trophic levels, resource use efficiency, production and top yield (fish), and reduced the temporal variability in trophic level biomasses and the strength of trophic cascading. It also enhanced robustness against pulse perturbations, while robustness against press perturbation was more context-dependent. Strikingly, high diversity on all trophic levels was necessary to ensure efficient exploitation of the available nutrients and primary production, and an efficient biomass transfer to higher trophic levels. The way horizontal diversity was modelled (a high number of functional groups with fixed trait values vs. few groups with a high potential to adapt) partly influenced the resulting ecosystem functions. We confirmed part of these model predictions also with chemostat experiments. Our studies together reveal that the mechanisms by which diversity influences ecosystem functioning are affected by the diversity of every part of the food web, preventing a straightforward or reliable extrapolation of insights from simple mono- or bitrophic systems to complex natural food webs.",3,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza B,

Specifically, we present results testing how changes in heritable trait variation in defense and competitiveness traits in a prey population contributes to the persistence of a predator population when exposed to a perturbation. We used clones of the green alga <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em> that differ in defensive and competitive traits as prey, the rotifer <em>Brachionus calyciflorus</em> as predator and microplastic particles as external perturbation. The microplastics directly affected the predator's food acquisition and thus indirectly its growth, and the effects were dependent on the prey traits. We tested how the persistence of the predator depended on the combination of the prey traits and on the strength of the perturbation. Trait variation in the prey population buffered the negative effects of the perturbation on predator’s ingestion and growth. As a result, large prey trait variation indirectly facilitated the persistence of the predator population under strong perturbations where it would go extinct without prey trait variation. Overall, the recognition of indirect evolutionary processes improves predictions of population dynamics in the presence of perturbations.",4,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza B,

So far, we only partially understand the mechanisms behind such large-scale changes due to inadequate data and analytical methods, limiting our ability to anticipate them. Changes in how species interact with each other (i.e., interaction networks) can signal large-scale changes in the whole ecosystem. Thus, studying communities as ecological networks offers a promising way to unravel the mechanisms behind large-scale ecosystem changes and the consequences for ecosystem stability. Here, we rely on four years of daily plankton abundance data and environmental drivers from an automated monitoring platform in a Swiss lake. We paired this high-frequency data with equation-free modeling tools to reconstruct the time-varying ecological interaction networks.

Studies about biodiversity and ecosystem functions mostly considered only one aspect of horizontal diversity at a single trophic level. Hence, we explored 3 relationships between horizontal diversity and ecosystem functions at two trophic levels: richness, adaptive potential, and the combined effect of both aspects. We defined producer and herbivore functional groups by their edibility and selectivity traits, respectively, which are involved in growth-defense and grazing-selectivity trade-offs. Expectedly, increasing producer richness had the strongest effect: saturating with producer biomass and its coefficient of variation, and reducing herbivore biomass, production, and top-down control. Functional diversity, quantified via a newly developed index, strongly increased up to 2-3 groups and saturated. High producer and herbivore richness increased selectivity, trophic transfer efficiency and temporal stability, while coadaptation enhanced top-down control and lowered temporal stability. Increasing both aspects of horizontal diversity promoted herbivore coexistence via a higher selectivity. Overall, we encourage including both aspects of horizontal diversity in models, since adaptive interactions between several groups represent more realistically natural diversity, and a limited number of groups eases mechanistic insights and coexistence.&nbsp;",5,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza B,

The model predicts an emergent functional response similar to Holling type III, but with richer dynamics and a more rigorous theoretical foundation. We show how our optimal behavior model not only increases model stability, but also has important implications for trophic control within the food web; allowing more realistic and diverse food web structures, without compromising the model’s ability to capture key ecosystem responses to environmental change.

In this study, we simulate the dynamics of phytoplankton and three of its functional traits (cell size, optimal temperature, optimal irradiance) using the eco-evolutionary model SPEAD (Simulating Plankton Evolution with Adaptive Dynamics). SPEAD uses an aggregate approach whereby the state variables of the model are the statistical moments of the traits: total phytoplankton biomass, mean trait values, trait variances (a proxy for diversity), and inter-trait covariances. We couple SPEAD to a vertically-resolved physical environment, and validate its bulk properties with observations from BATS (Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Studies) in the Sargasso Sea. Competitive exclusion tends to reduce diversity over time. To counter this effect, we tested two different diversity-sustaining schemes: “trait diffusion” (TD), where diversity is sustained by random mutations, and “Kill-The-Winner” (KTW), where zooplankton grazes preferentially upon the most abundant species. We compare and discuss the realism of both mechanisms. We show that diversity is also maintained and structured by the seasonal succession of stratification and mixing of the euphotic layer.

To test this hypothesis, we performed a long-term analysis of plankton biomass (1994-2019) and found contrasting trends, with abundances of some groups showing a decreasing trend (phytoplankton) while others increasing (zooplankton and bacteria), suggesting the occurrence of trophic cascades. We created food web models for each year of observation and constructed a time series of the ecological webs. The results showed that the plankton food web was resilient and maintained high energy fluxes despite the warming of the ocean surface.

The estuaries of Sundarbans mangrove witness diurnal tides that result in sharp changes in salinity and pH in surface water. In addition, there is influx of litterfall that can either aid in the buffering capacity and further tip alkalinity values, resulting in more acidic conditions. High temperature of the tropical regions changes atmospheric dynamicity, altered pCO<sub>2 </sub>levels and these are ultimately reflected in mangroves in terms of sink or source of carbon dioxide. It is thus imperative to understand the influence of this estuarine variability in pH in the backdrop of ocean acidification. A mesocosm experiment was set-up to study the influence of coastal pH on the resident phytoplankton communities. The pH levels were altered by ±0.5 units from the <em>in-situ</em> value measured during collection. Total phytoplankton abundances were observed to be higher than the control in both pH±0.5 set-ups. However, sharp changes in community structure were only observed till Day 4, after which the relative abundance of phytoplankton taxa appears to remain study. Dissolved nutrients including nitrate and reactive silicate were significantly lower at the end of the experiment indicating uptake by biological communities including phytoplankton. Such intricate mesocosm experiments can provide deep insights into resilience and succession of phytoplankton taxa under ocean acidification scenarios in dynamic coastal biotopes such as mangroves.",2,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 2,

The Sundarbans mangrove, the world’s largest continuous mangrove, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a RAMSAR site, along with long intertidal zones, represent characteristic features of this region. The Sundarbans mangrove contributes livelihood to coastal communities and regional GDPs. Over the last decade, anthropogenic climate change, including the ‘urbanization’ of coastal oceans, has become a primary driver toward changing environmental conditions in the Sundarbans. The scales of anthropogenic disturbances were characterized through benthic foraminifera coenosis over the seasons and robust measurement of organic carbon. Extensive sampling of the significantly different microhabitats highlighted the overwhelming abundance of calcareous taxa <em>Ammonia </em>spp., <em>Quinqueloculina </em>spp. A notable abundance of dead and degraded tests indicated potential taphonomic alterations that indicated changes influenced by the lowering of porewater oxygen content and possible changes in N:P stoichiometry. Organic carbon values exhibited wide variation, indicating the increasing intensity of human activity in recent years. Evidence of anaerobic degradation of sediment organic matter resulted in changes in sediment pH and taphonomic alteration of benthic foraminifera tests.

In this study, phytoplankton community assemblages were deduced from the Dakshineswar site located in the Hooghly estuary to quantify and understand the health status of Hooghly estuary. Surface water samples were collected from six pre-defined stations of Dakshineswar spanning across monsoon and post-monsoon seasons of 2019 and 2020. Stations were categorized into point source and surface water based on proximity to municipal discharges. Measurement of in situ environmental parameters showed significant differences in values for dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity and suspended particulate matter between the two seasons during the study period. In particular, concentrations of dissolved nitrate and silicate were found to be higher in point source stations compared to surface water stations. The concentration of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was found to be higher in post-monsoon compared to monsoon seasons. Phytoplankton communities consisted of 23 diatom taxa and 14 green algal taxa and they showed distinct seasonal and spatial variations in the study site. Phytoplankton communities were dominated by diatom taxa, Aulacoseira, Bacillaria, Coscinodiscus, and green algal taxa such as Ulothrix Chlorella, and Scenedesmus. A dramatic increase in cell abundance of Aulacoseira spp. in post-monsoon seasons indicates a bloom-like scenario. Moreover, the rapid increase in cell abundance of Aulacoseira spp. also coincided with an increase in Chl-a and a sharp fall in the concentration of dissolved silicate. Some of the encountered phytoplankton taxa such as Tetraedron, Cosmarium, Nitzschia, and Scenedesmus showed strong co-occurrence patterns indicating possible association at ecological scales. Four distinct clusters were formed innMDSordination plot based on the influences of environmental variables on encountered phytoplankton taxa.

These anthropogenic activities result in the accumulation of a wide range of toxic xenobiotic compounds in the ecosystem, microplastics being one of them. The present study investigated the abundance and composition of microplastics in surface water of Indian Sundarbans along with the application of metagenomic approach in exploring the&nbsp;microbial community&nbsp;structure and mining the genes involved in the biodegradation of various xenobiotics. The world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, Sundarbans, is a UNESCO world heritage site and a Ramsar site. Sundarbans is shared between Bangladesh and India, which are among the top mismanaged plastic waste generating nations and are discharging plastic waste downstream through rivers and coasts, making the Sundarbans a cesspit for plastic waste. The observed mean abundance of microplastics is 22.27±11.8 Particles/Liter in monsoon and 14.52±7.97 Particle/Liter in post-monsoon. Fiber constituted the major portion amongst the different forms of microplastics including fragment, microbead and foam. Moreover, chemical characterization of microplastics revealed polypropylene as the most abundant type of polymer. Mangroves are the hotspots for microbial diversity and harbor microbiota involved in producing a variety of degrading enzymes, antibiotics, etc. Metagenomic profiling of the surface water samples reported Proteobacteria as a dominant phylum, with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes the second-most in prevalence. The functional profiling revealed the presence of enzymes involved in the biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds such as Benzoate compounds, Nitrotoluene, Chlorocyclohexane, and Chlorobenzene, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), xylene, bisphenol, and Dioxin. The results also showed the presence of potential genes associated with the biodegradation of different types of plastic polymers such as PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoates), PBAT (Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)), PET (Polyethylene terephthalate), LDPE (Low-density Polyethylene), PS (Polystyrene), Nylon. The study not only fills up the scientific gap in our knowledge regarding the microplastic pollution in Indian Sundarbans but also provides an insight into the rich source of the gene pool, which is actively involved in the degradation of various xenobiotic compounds.&nbsp; &nbsp;",1,560,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Adjoining coastal waters surrounding the Antarctic continent support rich marine ecosystems and is highly productive yet strongly influenced by seasonality and inter-annual variability. The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) experiences rapidly changing oceanographic conditions leading to observed shifts in productivity and microbial community composition. To better predict the implications of temporal variability and future climate change conditions on the microbial community composition, productivity and community resilience, a key but currently less understood aspect of Antarctic coastal microbial ecology needs to be explored – inter-species and microbial-environmental interactions. This study explores interactions of prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes though a high-throughput sequence dataset of ~200 samples from 2 sites in the WAP encompassing all austral seasons. We predict community interactions via sequence abundance data and a causal network reconstruction algorithm, allowing us to infer not just the key interactions and species involved, but the interaction direction that can aid in teasing apart complex mechanisms governing Antarctic coastal microbial ecology, biogeochemical processes, and productivity.

The mangroves surrounding the Bay of Bengal receives nitrogen inputs from multiple sources including from continuous anthropogenic activities with effects on structure and functioning of resident biological communities. The main objective of this study was to track the effect of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) pool influenced by anthropogenic nitrogen on resident bacterioplankton communities in Sundarbans, world’s largest contiguous mangrove wetland. Using ‘omics’ based high-throughput sequencing of bacterioplankton communities based on sequencing of V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA (32777527 pair-end reads) and robust DIN pool quantification, a large number of stations representing from west to east of Sundarbans were classified as low DIN (&gt;45μM) and high DIN (&lt;40 μM) stations. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were the dominant bacterioplankton phyla across all stations. Nitrogen-fixing groups such as Nitrospirae, Lentisphaerae, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes were found to make up about1% of the bacterioplankton communities. Abundances of Spirochaetes and Tenericutes showed a positive correlation with DIN. Pseudomonadales, Alteromonadales, and Desulfovibrionales were found to distinctly vary in abundance between Low and High DIN stations. Predicted metagenomic profiles from taxonomically derived community structures indicated bacterial nitrate-nitrite reductase to be negatively correlated with prevalent DIN concentration in High DIN stations but positively correlated in Low DIN stations. This trend was also consistent for genes encoding for nitrate/nitrite response regulators and transporter proteins. The identified high DIN stations incidentally also exhibited signs reeling from nitrogen pollution including loss of biodiversity. Moreover, trait based microbes such as populations of Synechococcus which were able to metabolize urea were found.&nbsp;The new DIN approach coupled with ‘omics’&nbsp; based biomonitoring provides a new mechanistic classification of mangroves reeling from nitrogen pollution and can form the basis for targeted ecosystem restoration as well as to improve the concept of sustainable blue economy.",1,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 2,

Cyprus lows are responsible for cold weather, rainfall, and for an increase in cloudiness causing a decrease in solar radiation over the eastern Mediterranean and north Israel (including Lake Kinneret). In the daytime, comparison between HP and LP years of Kinneret surface water temperature (SWT) and epilimnion water temperature (WT) showed water cooling of up to 2 °C in HP years. This study was carried out using the 21-year period of satellite and in-situ data: (1) MODIS 1 km × 1 km resolution records of SWT, in (2) shipboard measurements of WT vertical profiles down to a depth of ~40 m (2000–2020). We found that a decrease in solar radiation caused by Cyprus lows (due to an increase in cloudiness) was the main factor contributing to Kinneret water cooling. In winter (December–January) when solar radiation (SR) was minimal, no water cooling was observed: the WT difference between HP and LP years was insignificant. However, in spring (March–April) when SR increased and became the main factor contributing to water heating, water cooling was observed: SWT and epilimnion WT, averaged over the HP years, was lower by ~2 °C and ~1.4 °C, respectively, than SWT and epilimnion WT, averaged over the LP years.

In remote sensing, different formulas and methods are available to detect water-covered areas and satellite maps through open-source platforms are available from increasingly longer timeframes. Our aim was to test the suitability of different remote sensing methods by validating them with our dataset based on manual measurements and determining the limitations of the methods. As study systems, we selected 6 temporary soda pans in Central Europe. First, by using all the available open-source maps recorded by the Sentinel 2 satellites with 2-week intervals from the last 8 years, we measured the flooded surface areas on the RGB, false-color and MNDWI images with QGIS.&nbsp; Then we performed a time series analysis by the MNDWI formula using the Google Earth Engine, and compared the estimated data with that of the manually measured dataset. We found a strong correlation between the two dataset, however the relationship was less clear in the different methods.

Lakes can act as a sentinel of climate change in arid areas as water quantity and quality changes are tightly linked with climate forcing. This study focusses on Lake Qadisiyah in Iraq, which is formed after the construction of the Haditha Dam on Euphrates River. The objective of this study is to investigate how climate can impact the water quantity and quality in an arid lake. To achieve this objective, we used the lake water level, chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and turbidity data in the period of 2002-2019 from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (Lakes_cci) product. We also used the air temperature, wind speed and precipitation data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis V5 (ERA 5) dataset, the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) from MODIS product and the standard precipitation index (SPI) product from Copernicus Emergency Management Service in the lake catchment, as well as the Multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index (MEI) data from NOAA in between 2002 and 2019, to investigate the reason of water quantity and water quality changes in Lake Qadisiyah. Our results showed that there is clear seasonality for lake water level, Chl-a and turbidity, with the highest Chl-a and turbidity in October but highest water level in March. In terms of long-term change, the water level clearly decreased in the periods of 2008-2011and 2017-2019. Meanwhile, Chl-a concentration and turbidity increased significantly in those two periods. The decrease of water level in these two periods is associated with the severe droughts happened in 2008 and 2017 in the lake catchment. The droughts were mainly caused by the La Niña events, which finally led to lower precipitations in the lake catchment than other years. In addition, our results showed another water level decrease in 2014-2015, but there is no severe drought in that period. We found that this water level decrease possibly caused by human activities, i.e., the flow cut off upstream and the water release from the dam. This study shows how climate and human activities can present impacts on water quantity and water quality in lakes in arid area, and can provide useful information for water management, and help to deal with water crisis in arid area in the background of climate change.

Lake mixing depends on a combination of climatic factors, thus, climate change can push the mixing regime of lakes toward tipping points and potentially generates mixing regime shifts, with consequences for the entire lake ecosystem. Despite the importance of lake mixing regime shifts, we lack a systematic overview of their occurrence, mainly due to the lack of systematic data to detect and analyse them worldwide. Satellite Earth Observations (EO) have the capacity to monitor lakes globally, thus developing methods that use satellite EO only to detect lake mixing regime shifts could be helpful. Satellite EO provide only skin temperature without resolving vertical gradients, however, the characterization of gradients in the horizontal dimension could help to deduct related vertical processes. We use the spatial component of remotely sensed lake surface water temperature (Lake CCI dataset) to reveal information about lake mixing and mixing anomalies. Particularly, we apply a thermal front tracking method to identify mixing anomalies in dimictic lakes worldwide, producing the first global-scale assessment of lake mixing anomalies occurrence in the last 20 years. Results show that lakes experiencing more mixing anomalies are also those more susceptible to undergo a mixing regime shift.

LIC is therefore recognized by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) of WMO as a thematic product of lakes as an essential climate variable. Changes in LIC, in particular dates associated with ice phenology (freeze-up, break-up and ice duration), have wide-ranging ecological, economic and societal impacts (e.g., physical/chemical/biological processes, transportation on ice roads, winter recreation). Long-term changes in ice phenology have been documented globally from in situ observational networks in several investigations. However, ice records from these networks have drastically declined in many northern countries over the last ca. three decades.

In reservoirs, prominent gradients for turbidity and co-occurring factors often occur between inlets and outlets, making them useful for rapid characterizations of ecosystem structure across diverse conditions while enabling potentially powerful tests of relationships between in situ and remotely sensed indices of water color. We used a sensor-equipped boat in a clay-rich subtropical drinking water reservoir to examine spatially intensive patterns of surface turbidity, and the relationship between in situ turbidity and normalized difference turbidity index (ndti) from Sentinel 2 imagery acquired on the same date.

Jellyfish organism is modeled as a sphere with density which is 0.1% higher than the density of seawater. Organism fragmentation is modeled as a recursive decay of each existing fragmented particle into N&nbsp;new particles, but following exponential mass distribution over all fragmented masses. Strict mass conservation is enforced during each fragmentation event. Decay probability&nbsp;scales as a nonlinear function of mass so that more massive particles decay with larger probability. Vertical settling velocity of each fragment is computed as the terminal velocity of the respective buoyant particle in the linear Stokes drag regime. It scales nonlinearly with mass, making more massive particles sink faster, leading to a vertical dispersion of mass and particle distribution. Settling velocity of the mass distribution maximum seems consistent with reported estimates. Horizontal currents are simulated as a linear combination of semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal signals, perturbed by a stochastic component of similar amplitude. We simulate an ensemble of scenarios over a broad range of decay probabilities, fragmented mass distributions and circulation regimes.

These blooms often collapse <em>en masse</em> leading to a release of large amount of labile detrital organic matter (OM) into ambient seawater. We conducted two microcosms experiments, simulating the scenario experienced by coastal bacterial communities after the decay of the jellyfish (<em>Aurelia aurita</em><em> </em>s.l.) and ctenophore (<em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>) bloom in the northern Adriatic Sea. Despite fundamental genetic, biochemical and life history differences between the two gelatinous organisms, high similarities in the metabolic responses of the ambient bacterial communities were observed. Combined metagenomics and metaproteomics analysis revealed that the bacterial consortium degrading both types of gelatinous detritus was dominated by <em>Pseudoalteromonas </em>exhibiting high production of proteolytic exoenzymes and elevated metabolic activity. Interestingly, despite the two experiments were carried out in different years, we were able to reconstruct an almost identical metagenome-assembled genome (nucleic identity &gt;99%) of <em>Pseudoalteromonas phenolica</em> dominating both datasets. Taken together our data suggest that similar to well-studied phytoplankton, also gelatinous blooms likely trigger a consistent response of natural bacterial communities, however, supporting faster growth rates and higher bacterial growth efficiency than phytoplankton-derived OM.",1,575,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

We collected presence records of the distribution of dominant GZ species (2 scyphozoans, 2 hydrozoans, 2 ctenophores, and 2 larvaceans) throughout the Arctic Ocean and adjacent marginal seas using existing scientific literature and public databases. We used this information to build three-dimensional species distribution models to understand the current distribution of species and their realized niches. These models, combined with climate change scenarios, allowed us to project future range shifts, and identify potential climate-change winners and losers. Our projections show that as temperatures continue to rise, several boreal species, such as Cyanea capillata and Periphylla periphylla, will expand their range further north.

A review paper (Young &amp; Hagadorn, 2020) listed only 13 confirmed deposits of fossil medusae associated with specific paleoenvironmental settings. Although most medusa fossils have been preserved in paleoenvironments such as shallow sandy shores, estuaries, and lagoons, they may also be fossilised in deeper muddy environments. The material we studied consists of specimens preserved in the Eocene flysch of the Adriatic foreland near the Dinaric trust front. The fossil medusae in question were discovered in a quarry on the Slovenian coast. The putative medusa moulds occur on the lower bedding plane of the medium-grained sandstone, that was formed by an hyperpicnal flow. They exhibit positive relief, are circular to ellipsoidal, and vary in size from 6.5 to 24.5 cm. Most specimens stand in isolation, but some partially overlap. The morphology of these fossils is consistent with that of cnidarian medusae and appear to be analogues of extant scyphozoan Discomedusae. Fossilisation may have occurred after the sinking of the decaying medusa bloom, followed by possible further benthic downward transport leading to the accumulation of medusa carcasses in deep water.

The ecosystems of Jobos Bay NERR (JBNERR),&nbsp;Puerto Rico are under constant threat of degradation by anthropogenic activity, sea-level rise and associated hydrological changes. Because migration of these ecosystems is limited by coastal development, implementing effective management-action plans are essential. The focus of this project is to assess the potential of <em>Cassiopea</em> as bioindicators of nutrient pollution and other anthropogenic disturbances in coastal ecosystems. Research goals include to: (1) assess distributions of <em>Cassiopea</em> in the shallow subtidal zone adjacent to JBENRR; (2) determine the physico-chemical conditions that influence their blooms across the reserve; and (3) develop and implement a long-term monitoring strategy for <em>Cassiopea</em> populations in coastal waters of Puerto Rico. Nine sites have been established in areas of Jobos Bay, three each as high, mild, and low human impact. Each site includes five transects within a 10 x 25 m plot.

Kongsfjorden, on the west coast of Spitsbergen, is under influence of an Atlantic-water inflow and, thus, particularly impacted by Atlantification. This well-studied fjord is a sentinel of ongoing change and a study model system for the state of the future Arctic, including the advection of boreal-Atlantic species. The focus of our study lies on gelatinous zooplankton (GZP). This group includes cnidarians and ctenophores, which are can reach a high biomass in short time periods. Hence, these groups can constitute a seasonally major contribution to the vertical carbon flux in jellyfish dominated systems. These so-called “jelly-falls” might represent a food source for benthic scavengers and omnivores. Food fall experiments demonstrated that “jelly-falls” are scavenged upon swiftly after their arrival on the seafloor by a specific scavenging community. Here, we investigate the role of jellyfish in the diet of amphipods as major scavengers and omnivores in the Kongsfjorden ecosystem during the Polar Night. During this time of the year, food supply for benthic communities might be limited, thus the locally abundant GZP could represent an important food source in winter. We applied mtCOI metabarcoding on the stomach contents of lysianassoid (<em>Anonyx</em> and <em>Orchomenella</em>) and gammarid (<em>Gammarus</em> spp.) species to investigate their diet spectrum to find evidence of jellyfish feeding.

We report results on the prey diversity of <em>Salpa aspera </em>from a field expedition of the Ocean Twilight Zone project in the NW Atlantic Ocean. Diet composition was determined with DNA metabarcoding analysis of the gut contents of <em>Salpa aspera</em><em>.</em> Salps (solitary and aggregate forms) for this study were collected in vertically-stratified tows (0 – 200, 200 – 400, 400 – 600, 600 – 1000 m) of a 10-m<sup>2</sup> MOCNESS in the NW Atlantic Slope Water during March 2020. DNA was extracted from salp gut contents and sequenced for V4 and V9 hypervariable regions of the 18S rRNA gene. Taxonomic assignments of V4 and V9 sequences were resolved and classified using custom scripts and reference databases. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to compare prey composition for salps collected from 4 depth strata at 5 stations. When combined with diel vertical distribution patterns from in situ shadowgraph imaging, results of the metabarcoding analysis of the salp diet were used to summarize the trophic relationships of <em>S. aspera</em>, infer sources of productivity, evaluate the impacts of salp forms (aggregate or solitary) and vertical migration on particle and energy transfer in the mesopelagic ecosystem.",3,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

Abundances and distributions can be poorly resolved by plankton net sampling due to patchiness, a problem that is further compounded by the damage inflicted on fragile soft-bodied organisms during collection. High resolution data is limited by practical constraints on both sample collection and taxonomic analysis. To resolve these challenges, we have deployed an <em>In Situ</em>&nbsp;Ichthyoplankton Imaging System Deep-Focus Particle Imager (ISIIS-DPI) to describe zooplankton community structure in the NGA. The ISIIS-DPI is an undulating towed vehicle with a wide array of mounted instrumentation, and an imaging system of 3 line-scan cameras that images ~250 liters/second while conserving the scale of particles and plankton. Deployments are illuminating the substantial variability occurring within most components of the epipelagic zooplankton community. In particular, here we will describe the fine-scale vertical and horizontal aggregative patterns of gelatinous zooplankton abundance and distribution in the NGA, and relate them to biophysical drivers. For example, we show that abundances are elevated around frontal features, as well as concentrated near the pycnocline.&nbsp; Furthermore, we will demonstrate the prominence of the most fragile members of the gelatinous zooplankton - ctenophores - within the NGA that are virtually missed by traditional sampling methods.",4,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

Climate variability is enhancing the frequency and severity of wildfires and heatwaves, intensifying the water cycle, and resulting in an increase in precipitation and flood risk. Drought severity, as a result of warming conditions and poor land management across many parts of the world, is also expected to further exacerbate the potential for extreme weather. The catastrophic bushfires that occurred across eastern Australia in the ‘black summer’ of 2019-2020 were unprecedented in terms of their intensity and severity. These ‘megafires’ were preceded by prolonged drought with record-breaking high temperatures, and were followed by widespread and heavy rainfall. While estuaries along the eastern seaboard of Australia provide vital ecosystem services supporting environmental, cultural, social and commercial values, there have been few studies to date that examine the effects of such wildfires (eg. the remobilization and deliverance of pollutants such as trace elements) on these aquatic systems. In this work, we determined the impact of catastrophic weather conditions on twelve oyster-growing estuaries spanning ~1000 km of sub-tropical coastline over two years. We investigated high frequency, real-time temperature and salinity sensor data, fortnightly water samples for phytoplankton enumeration (including harmful species), and we deployed Sydney rock oysters (<em>Saccostrea glomerata</em>) as biomonitors of trace metal contamination, both before, during and after the 2019/2020 extreme weather events. Using these data we modelled the impact of these extreme events on estuarine water quality, including the risk of harmful algal blooms (HAB) globally.

In this study, we first presented the spatial distribution of both PPP and DPP in the summer of 2019 in the East China Sea (ECS), as well as hydrological parameters. In short, the depth-integrated PPP ranged from 103 to 802 mgC m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> with an average of 291 ± 183 mgC m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, while the depth-integrated DPP ranged from 149 to 1252 mgC m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> with an average of 374 ± 286 mgC m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. High PPP and DPP occurred nearshore with low salinity and high nutrient concentrations and decreased offshore, indicating the positive impact from the Yangtze River discharge. The percent of extracellular release (PER), defined as the contribution of DPP to the total primary production, ranged 34.9 % to 75.8 % with an average of 55.3 %&nbsp;± 11.3 %, indicating more than half of photosynthetically fixed carbon flowed as the dissolved form into seawater in the ECS.

Given their global abundance and ecological diversity, &nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/em&gt; provides an excellent model system to understand how salinity changes may alter biogeochemical cycling. Here, we investigated the phylogenomic distribution and salinity tolerance of six &nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/em&gt; strains isolated from a singular location – Martha’s Vineyard Coastal Observatory. Phylogenomic analysis showed the strains represent all three subclusters (5.1, 5.2, and 5.3). While 5.1 and 5.3 showed classical salinity evolutionary transitions, 5.2 had numerous instances of salinity transitions across the subcluster. Physiological experiments showed strains from 5.1 and 5.3 had a salinity range between 17.9 to 35.56, while cultivars from 5.2 grew across a broad range of salinities. Cultivar genomes from 5.1 and 5.3 recruited best at salinities &gt; 15, while cultivar genomes from 5.2 were more variable with some restricted to low brackish sites while one was recruited&nbsp;across disparate salinities.

However, few studies have tested this directly, especially outside of coastal ocean upwelling-influenced regions. Furthermore, chemical measurements of B1 &amp; congeners from coastal seawater are generally scarce. To examine these unknowns, we measured B1 &amp; congeners in North Atlantic coastal ocean and estuarine surface water alongside bacterial production, cell abundance, and water chemistry to test for linkages between these parameters. Additionally, vitamin addition bottle incubations were performed to test for induced changes in community composition (based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) and bacterial production. Vitamin-only additions altered bacterial production in 5 of 19 total incubations, and in 13 of the experiments there was evidence of co-limitation based on vitamin and macronutrient (C, N, P) treatments.

This process can originate changes in the biomass and structure of phytoplankton assemblages, favouring the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs), that may have detrimental consequences on ecosystem functioning. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of increased nutrient loads on harmful and non-harmful phytoplankton species in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon (SE Portugal), an important socio-economic ecosystem, subjected to increasing anthropogenic impacts. To accomplish this, six nutrient enrichment experiments, with four experimental treatments (control, N, P, N+P), were conducted between July and September 2022, using natural plankton assemblages from two locations in the lagoon (landward boundary and urban boundary). Samples were collected at the beginning and end of the experiment for the analysis of inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and phytoplankton abundance and composition, using inverted microscopy. Results were consistent across all experiments and suggest that the phytoplankton assemblages in the Ria Formosa may be co-limited by N and P. In&nbsp;an ecosystem where light limitation rarely occurs, nutrient availability is a major abiotic driver of phytoplankton. Thus, understanding how nutrient concentrations and ratios influence phytoplankton dynamics is of major importance to understand how potential eutrophication scenarios may regulate HAB development in this coastal lagoon.",2,581,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In June of 2021 we sampled coastal waters in Eastsound by collecting the bacterial microbiome every 4 hours for 22 days, with additional time-matched samples for environmental and water chemistry analyses. The metagenome was sequenced and a quantitative metaproteomic analysis performed on the last 6 days of the timeseries during a period characterized by low environmental disturbance preceding a Chaetoceros bloom. The microbiome revealed a rapid shift in profile prior to the initiation of the HAB, characterized by an increase in peptides attributed to bacterial classes <em>Opitutae</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobiae</em>. These bacteria, previously documented for their potential to degrade complex HAB biproducts, were primarily engaged in regulation of nitrogen utilization and protein synthesis, with an observed increase in energy acquisition, glucose metabolism, and cell replication prior to the HAB.

Microorganisms are rarely included in reef monitoring efforts. However, bacterial and archaeal communities may be ideal targets for monitoring because they are the most abundant organisms on the reef, they respond to changes quickly due to fast growth rates and they are hypothesized to facilitate reef decline through microbialization.

We monitored algal and coral benthic cover as well as nutrient concentrations, microbial cell abundances and composition of microbial communities in the overlying water column. Over time and coincident with disturbances, we observed an increase in algal cover on the reefs, consistent with algal phase-shifts. The ongoing disease outbreak coincided with enriched ammonium in reef water, but a loss of microbial community diversity and the numerically abundant primary producer, <em>Prochlorococcus</em>.

To evaluate how dust deposition affects bacterial responses under changing temperature conditions, two-month field mesocosm experiments covering a dust concentration gradient (five levels, 0-320mg/L) were conducted in La Caldera, a sentinel oligotrophic lake in Southern Spain. Sampling design included three 10-day paired laboratory experiments with three temperature treatments (control, warming and fluctuating), to assess the effects of these two stressors at different points in time: two, five and ten weeks after dust addition. Bacterial response was driven by the ratio of light attenuation to phosphorus availability, which differed across the dust concentration gradient. Overall, chlorophyll and bacteria were directly correlated with dust concentration, both peaking two weeks after dust addition and reaching five-fold higher values in the highest level of dust treatment. Temperature influenced how bacterial production varied across dust treatments only in the first paired laboratory experiment. In the second and third experiments, addition of the highest level of dust (320mg/L) caused bacterial production to double relative to all other levels regardless of temperature. We conclude that intermediate levels of dust (80-160 mg/L) provide optimal light and nutrient conditions that allow for long-term bacterial proliferation.

To assess the effects of nutrients (e.g., nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate) on reef microbiomes (16S rRNA amplicons), synoptic water samples were collected and analyzed from 200 sites/year. We related patterns in nearshore microbial assemblages and specific bacterial taxa associated with 1) reef habitat (nearshore, bay, offshore), 2) nutrient type and concentration, and 3) island shore (west, north, east). Initial analyses suggest a positive association between a subset of nutrient variables (phosphate, nitrate+nitrite) between years and microbiome features such as richness, and Shannon and phylogenetic diversity. Key microbes were also found to be differentially associated with specific habitats. These data serve to identify reef regions uniquely impacted by runoff and/or other chemical or biological features that limit reef resilience.",3,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

The composition of these virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) can expand the functional repertoire of individual cells, with measurable impacts on microbial diversity. However, their distribution, diversity, and function remain poorly constrained in productive coastal ecosystems with high macronutrient turnover, such as coral reefs. In this study, we examined the composition of AMGs associated with scleractinian and hydrocorals in island systems spanning the South Pacific utilizing both existing public metagenomes and those sequenced from the Tara Pacific expedition (2016-2018). <em>Nucleocytoviricota</em> (NCLDV) sequences – large viruses distinguished by extensive acquisition of cellular genes - were found among all metagenomes, illustrating their ubiquity in these niches, and their existence was supported by TEM (virus-like particles &gt;430nm). Putative endogenized viral elements were also identified in Symbiodiniaceae, providing evidence of horizontal gene transfer between viruses and dinoflagellate coral symbionts. We leveraged experimental transects (Moorea, French Polynesia) to characterize AMG repertoire after nutrient amendment, informing how virus-mediated patterns of horizontal transfer influence the structure and succession of these coastal microbial communities.

These dynamic ecosystems are affected by a variety of abiotic and biotic factors from both marine and freshwater sources. Estuaries are microbially diverse and spatiotemporally heterogeneous in microbial abundance, metabolic activity, and community structure due to natural physical and chemical gradients. Despite their ecological significance, bacterioplankton in particular are often overlooked in climate change models and research. Due to their ability to adapt quickly to changing environmental variables, they are ideal biological indicators of site variability. The tidal fresh portion of the Potomac River Estuary presents a unique ecosystem to study the effects of climate change on microbial dynamics. There is a paucity of data on the biological and functional diversity of microorganisms present in the Potomac River, a major tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, with only limited monitoring of fecal coliforms taking place. This is the first study to characterize bacterioplankton dynamics in this estuary using a combination of 16S rRNA, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics&nbsp;in relation to environmental parameters (nutrients, salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) with the goal of developing biological indicators to determine estuarine health and resilience under a changing climate.",6,577,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

While correlations between viral load and coral decline have been documented, it is unknown how coral physiology correlates with viral infection in the face of environmental disturbances, yet the diversity and function of coral viruses as part of the coral holobiont may shed light on the mechanisms that contribute to spatiotemporal trends in coral bleaching and disease. Thus we used metagenomic sequencing to assess the viral relative abundance and diversity on an island-wide spatiotemporal scale in Moorea, French Polynesia, from coral tissues across three coral host species, reef types, and varying levels of nutrient enrichment from 21 sites spanning a three-year time series. For genome assembly and annotation, we sequenced 178 metagenomic samples and used relative viral taxonomic abundance and diversity metrics paired with current and historical nutrient data to identify environmental variables that may contribute to viral production under typical conditions, as well as during an extreme thermal anomaly. We found that coral host, island region, reef type, and nutrient enrichment were the strongest explanatory variables for significant differences in viral community composition and function, including shifting virome baselines from a coral bleaching event during an extreme marine heatwave.

Since 2010, seagrass coverage has increased slightly. Since 2017 the University of West Florida (UWF), Escambia and Santa Rosa County Sea Grant Extension have worked together to enlist citizens and UWF students to monitor seagrass beds. Each month during the growing season (May-Sept), local citizens identify seagrass species and use quadrats to estimate coverage of seagrass and macroalgae at different locations in the Pensacola Bay system. They also collect water samples which are analyzed at UWF by students who measure salinity and total suspended solids (TSS). Students also measure water quality and collect water samples for dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll a from these locations two or three times during the growing season. Students have also developed individual research projects such as examining porewater nutrients or epiphyte coverage in seagrass beds. Their projects benefit from the data from the volunteer program which provides context for their studies.

Blooms were rare and not notably toxic before then. Could these blooms be related to climate-driven changes in nutrient loading? To address this, we examined long-term trends in N and P loads. Both nutrients may be important for toxic blooms in Cayuga Lake: the lake is strongly P-limited, but N may increase toxin production and reduce zooplankton grazing, leading to larger and longer blooms. We examined nutrient inputs from two rivers with watersheds varying in agricultural intensity, using monitoring data from a program initiated in 2002 by the Community Science Institute (CSI) that relies on citizen volunteers for sampling and runs an EPA-certified lab for chemical analyses. Total P inputs from both rivers were similar and have decreased over time, while inorganic N inputs were far higher from the watershed with more agriculture. Annual average inputs of inorganic N showed little change over time, but summer-time fluxes were much greater in 2017 than in 2016 and other prior dry years. We see strong evidence of this “whiplash effect” for both inorganic N and P, with storage in the watershed in dry years leading to high exports in subsequent wet years. This analysis would not be possible without the long-term data of the CSI program.

Hence, obtaining information on their conservation status and distribution is crucial for implementing effective conservation measures. Citizen science is a promising tool to provide this information on broad spatial and temporal scales while raising awareness of ocean conservation issues. Although the data quality of citizen-scientists has often been questioned, the design of volunteer training and the data validation by experts have allowed to overcome these initial concerns ensuring its reliability. This presentation shows how using two of the largest citizen science expert-validated datasets from Observadores del Mar and Reef Check Med can enhance our understanding of the conservation status and distribution of Mediterranean coralligenous species over time. Firstly, our study successfully validated the implementation of training programs for volunteers on assessing the conservation status of coralligenous key species. This highlights the importance of training and expert-validation in long-term citizen science projects. Secondly, this work combined species occurrences datasets from both, science and citizen science, with environmental information using Species Distribution Models, providing valuable insights into the main factors driving coralligenous species distribution.

Despite their importance, these underwater habitats are declining at fast rates, and a lack of public awareness underpins a general lack of protection. ‘Operation Crayweed’ and ‘Operation Posidonia’ are two projects based in Sydney (Australia) that combine science, storytelling and community engagement to restore seaweed and seagrass species and raise awareness about the importance of these marine habitats. ‘Crayweed’ (<em>Phyllospora comosa</em>) is a large seaweed that disappeared from the Sydney metropolitan coastline over 30 years ago as a result of sewage pollution. Operation Crayweed has developed a method to reintroduce self-sustaining populations of crayweed and has successfully reversed local extinction for the species. This good-news restoration success story was then used to engage local communities via short films, podcasts, art-meets-science projects and community plantings. ‘Posidonia’ (<em>Posidonia australis</em>) is a slow-growing seagrass that is declining rapidly in eastern Australia, where it is classified as endangered. Boat moorings that scour the seafloor and remove marine vegetation are one of its major threats. Operation Posidonia enlists local communities to collect seagrass shoots that become naturally detached following storms. These shoots are then planted in old boat mooring scars in a way that avoids damaging existing meadows while also engaging communities and increasing stewardship. High levels of hands-on engagement from the public in both Operation Crayweed and Operation Posidonia, in combination with high media interest, have led to rising levels of philanthropic and government funding for both restoration projects.

In this study, nitrogen fixation and the underpinning diazotroph communities were mapped over contrasting hydrographical and sea ice regimes in the unexplored central and eastern Arctic Ocean. Non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are putative key players in the Arctic and may take up dissolved organic carbon.

Optical surveys of the European Arctic surface waters were conducted during three polar research cruises of RV Oceania, in 2018, 2019 and 2021. Sampling of the surface microlayer (SML) and subsurface water (ULW, 1m) allowed us to calculate the enrichment factor (EF) of the SML in organic matter (OM) and in phytoplankton pigments - based on absorption and fluorescence measurements and HPLC analyses of the collected samples. Additionally, the analysis of absorption and fluorescence indices (E2:E3, SR, aCDOM(l), fluorescence intensities of the main chromophoric fractions of DOM in the sea: A, C, M and T, the ratio (M+T)/(A+C), HIX index, composition and concentration of phytoplankton pigments) allow to describe the properties of organic molecules. The analyses of EEMs of sea samples reveals that: (1) concentration of OM fractions - both in the SML and SS – depend on a study-region and a year; (2) enrichment factor of fluorescing fractions of OM yielded higher values in M and T than A and C components. The results reveal the relationships between phytoplankton and the concentration of various optically active organic matter components in the surface layer (0-1m) and microlayer (0-1mm).",2,591,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, there is a shortage of in situ data published, and those existing for the Arcitc that can match up in situ pigment data with satellite measurements are very limited due to high cloud cover in this region. This study explores the value of a large, previously unpublished, dataset of historical phytoplankton pigment data from the Arctic region collected over the 2000-2022 period and analyzed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A total of 900 sets of pigment data were used in the analyses which compares the spatio-temporal variability in the distribution of &nbsp;phytoplankton functional types in the Arctic between 2000-2005 and 2014-2022. By acquiring an unprecedented number of match-ups with satellite ocean colour measurements, we provide preliminary results from relating the observed patterns in pigment data with patterns detected from large scale satellite-based estimates of phytoplankton biomass and sea surface temperature among other environmental variables.

These fjords are fed by marine-terminating (MTG) and land-terminating glaciers (LTG). Global warming significantly impacts these systems through the accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet. This does not only increase total freshwater input into the fjords, but also leads to an accelerated retreat of MTGs, causing them to become LTGs in the near future. Previous studies shown that, in contrast to fjords with LTGs, summer upwelling of deep, nutrient-rich water induced by MTGs significantly increases productivity in their vicinity. It is hypothesized that this phenomenon causes fundamental differences in the structure and function of the pelagic compartment in both fjords types. We will present the results of two sampling campaigns (summer 2021 and spring 2022) carried out in the two main fjord systems near Nuuk, namely Nuup Kangerlua, dominated by MTG, and Ameralik, impacted by a LTG. Analyses of microbial community structure (DNA metabarcoding, Imaging Flow Cytometry, FlowCam, pigments), primary production, marine gel production (TEP), microzooplankton grazing and community respiration rates were carried out to assess differences in dynamics and functioning in the pelagic microbial compartment of the two fjords.

Knowledge about sources and sinks of nitrogen is, therefore, essential for the understanding of current and future productivity in the region. Nitrogen fixation has been reported in the Arctic Ocean, but data remain sparse. Here, we measured nitrogen fixation rates and examined the diazotroph community composition across the deepest gateway to the Arctic Ocean - the Fram Strait. Samples were obtained from two major currents and their frontal zone: the southbound Arctic-influenced East Greenland Current, the northbound Atlantic-influenced West Spitsbergen Current, and the Polar Front. Nitrogen fixation rates were measurable in 9 of 20 samples (0.02 – 10.15 nmol N l<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;d<sup>-1</sup>), detected only above 100 m. Rates were highest in the Atlantic-influenced water, positively correlated with temperature and silicate. Amplicon sequencing of the&nbsp;<em>nifH&nbsp;</em>marker<em>&nbsp;</em>gene revealed that non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs dominated across Fram Strait, with Proteobacteria accounting for 66% of all sequences.

Increased acidification is hypothesized to reduce iron bioavailability for marine phytoplankton thereby expanding iron limitation and impacting primary production. Here we show from community to molecular levels that iron-stressed phytoplankton in an upwelling region respond to short-term acidification exposure with a multitude of iron uptake pathways and strategies that reduce cellular iron demand. A multi-omics approach was applied to trace metal clean incubations that introduced 1200 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> for up to four days<sub>. </sub>Although variable, molecular-level responses indicate a prioritization of iron uptake pathways that are less hindered by acidification in conjunction with reductions in cellular iron utilization.

Using an autonomous underwater vehicle, the microbial communities were vertically sampled along the western North Atlantic Ocean.

Only protein pools demonstrated strong shifts in vertical structure at the supergroup level, with foraminifera, radiolaria, picozoa, and discoba enriched below 200m, and fungi enriched in seawater collected from below 3,000m. Relatively few haptophyte transcripts were observed in surface waters, yet they were a substantial fraction of the eukaryotic protein pool. We furthermore observed a difference in taxonomic annotations, with on average 38% of eukaryotic proteins unable to be confidently annotated below the supergroup level compared to 21% of transcripts. These proteins were functionally enriched in cytoskeletal components and may represent abundant, evolutionarily conserved proteins. Possible explanations for discrepancies between biochemical pools include lineage-specific loss of protein or RNA during lab processing, differences in RNA/protein composition and ratios among taxonomic groups, growth rate effects, and/or cell lysis during in situ filtration.

Our work delves into microbial genome size variation in benthic and pelagic habitats across environmental gradients of the brackish Baltic Sea. We found that, while depth is significantly associated with genome size in benthic and pelagic brackish metagenomes, salinity is only correlated to genome size in benthic metagenomes. Overall, we confirm that prokaryotic genome sizes in Baltic sediments (3.47 Mbp) are significantly bigger than in the water column (2.96 Mbp). Although benthic genomes have a higher number of metabolic functions than pelagic genomes, the smallest genomes coded for a higher number of module steps per Mbp for most of the functions irrespective of their environment. Some examples of this functions are amino acid metabolism and central carbohydrate metabolism. However, we observed that nitrogen metabolism was almost absent in pelagic genomes and was mostly present in benthic genomes. Finally, we also show that Bacteria inhabiting sediments and water column in the Baltic Sea not only differ in taxonomy, but also in their metabolic potential, such as the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway or the presence of different hydrogenases.

The biodiversity assessment of pelagic communities is often achieved using a CTD/rosette sampler for water sampling, followed by DNA extraction and metabarcoding of the filtered seawater. Nevertheless, studies addressing the reliability of eDNA water sampling methods and the temporal variation of eDNA in the water column are rare.&nbsp; Consequently, this study aims to determine a) if and how the metazoan community composition across the water column varies in a time span of a couple of hours as well as between specific depths, and b) if one CTD/rosette sampler deployment can comprehensively identify the local metazoan diversity in a dynamic fjord system. For this purpose, six rosette water sampler deployments were carried out successively, sampling at five different depths across the water column, at the same location in Porsangerfjorden, Norway. The metazoan diversity was determined using the mitochondrial cytochrome <em>c</em> oxidase I (COI) gene applying Illumina MiSeq for sequencing.

The Virginia Eastern Shore (VaES) is one such system with various potential sources, including an expanding poultry industry and the historical use of septic systems. Agricultural and residential land use within the small watersheds of the VaES, along with close proximity to tidal creeks make this a model landscape to examine the impacts of human and animal waste contamination on water quality. We developed an environmental DNA (eDNA) source-tracking method using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and metabarcoding analysis of mitochondrial 16S rDNA in different animals (e.g., human, chicken, cow, and dog). Increases in chicken fecal contamination followed the general pattern of broiler chicken production in the US, with an increase in chicken density and fecal contamination in the winter months. Increased human fecal contamination coincided with the influx of summer residents and tourists to the VaES and was positively correlated with dissolved organic nitrogen. Overall, levels of human fecal contamination exceeded those for chicken contamination. Using metabarcoding, we were able to identify other potential sources of fecal contamination, such as cattle farms and domestic dogs.

This is mainly related to sampling, in part because of the difficulty to access groundwater, but also because the scarcity of organisms requires extensive sampling effort. We overcame this in a two-fold approach. Firstly, we used citizen science with an extensive sampling of organisms in drinking water wells by water providers, followed by DNA barcoding. Secondly, we complemented it with water sampling and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We evaluated the possibility of combining these two approaches for gaining insights into the diversity of organisms living in aquifers, with a particular focus on amphipods. To that end, we sampled 20 drinking water wells in Switzerland. Although eDNA was not as efficient as the citizen science approach for detecting groundwater amphipods, the combination of both methods allowed us to reveal the distinct diversity associated to the different amphipod species identified. We also found a correlation between amphipod abundance and total biodiversity at each site, suggesting that amphipods could be used as bioindicators to evaluate the status of groundwater ecosystems.

Methods A new analytical framework based in the metabarcoding of community DNA and a hypervariable marker is presented. This framework allows the simultaneous detection of multispecies biogeographical and phylogeographical structures. Shallow hard-bottom communities were sampled at 12 sites over the littoral zone and community-DNA metabarcoding was performed using the cytochrome c oxidase I marker. The resulting dataset was analysed at several levels: beta diversity of Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) as surrogate for species, and Exact Sequence Variants as surrogate for haplotypes.

We summarize known or expected effects in this contribution, and discuss possibilities for mitigating effects. &nbsp; Windfarms extract energy from the wind and consequently modify the air-water interaction. In addition, energy is extracted from the tidal motion of the water and dissipated as turbulence. Both interactions change vertical mixing of the water column, affecting the distribution of dissolved and particulate matter. It is expected that, at least locally, this will lead to changes in primary production. Changes in bottom shear stress lead to altered suspended matter dynamics. Offshore solar primarily affects light climate, but may also interferes with physical effects of windfarms. &nbsp; Energy farms change the physical habitat characteristics of shallow seas, by introducing hard substrate in a soft-sediment environment. The transport of energy as electric current or, in the future, as hydrogen, may entail further habitat modifications. Large energy hubs and extensive cable and pipeline networks extend the physical impacts to sensitive coastal areas. This will change faunal communities and affect the balance between pelagic and benthic grazers. Indirectly, these changes may affect the food web in the sea and the biological factors responsible for pelagic-benthic exchange of mineral and organic matter.",0,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza B,"Invited, Tutorial"

In this study, we present the results of a field campaign aiming at quantifying these changes in hydrodynamics and suspended matter dynamics, allowing the assessment of their ecological impact. The campaign was undertaken in June 2022 in the Belgian Coastal Zone. We measured a set of hydrodynamic parameters at various locations around a single turbine, supplemented with water and sediment samples. The data show how the turbine enhances the local hydrodynamics. In the turbine wake, we observed an increase in turbulent kinetic energy. This led to a more well-mixed water column. At the water surface, this resulted in colder and more saline water, while the water near the seabed became warmer and less saline. These effects were closely linked to the direction of the tidal current, as the turbine-induced wake is only several turbine diameters wide. The wake length is much longer, extending for several hundreds of meters behind the turbine. This presentation discusses the study setup and the steps required to quantify the impact of turbines on local hydrodynamics. Furthermore, we will discuss how this knowledge is implemented in large-scale models, as this step is crucial for assessing the ecosystem impact of upscaled offshore wind installations.",4,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza B,

As such, the effects of the presence of high densities of fouling fauna on turbines on the marine ecosystem can be modulated through CC-induced alterations to their physiology. We performed a series of ecophysiological and pulse-chase experiments, where three key species from European turbines (the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, the amphipod Jassa herdmani and the anemone Metridium senile) are incubated in conditions mimicking the current situation, or increased temperature and/or decreased pH conditions.&nbsp; Our experiments revealed increased mortality of all species in CC conditions. Surviving individuals showed decreased growth rates coinciding with increased respiration and clearance rates. A back of the envelope calculation showed that the fouling fauna can clear a volume of water of about 7.5 olympic swimming pools under current conditions, increasing to 9 olympic swimmmig pools in the CC treatment. Our pulse chase experiments, involving the same three species and additional species living on turbines, surrounding water column and nearby sediment reveal that CC induced a higher community carbon assimilation, where the dominant role of the blue mussel decreased while the importance of Jassa herdmani increased. This all suggests that CC indeed can modulate the effect of offshore wind farms through an ecophysiological feedback loop.",1,610,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The presence of OWF turbines affects the local marine ecosystem structure and its functioning. The turbines provide new artificial hard substrates, rapidly colonized by epifaunal organisms, mainly consisting of suspension-feeding communities dominated by blue mussel (<em>Mytilus edulis</em>), tube-building amphipods (<em>Jassa herdmani</em>), and plumose anemones (<em>Metridium senile</em>). They feed by removing suspended particate matter, zooplankton, and phytoplankton from the water column, and return faecal pellets (FP) to the water column. These FP are thought to play a crucial role in the local organic matter (OM) dynamics and carbon sequestration in the sediment surrounding the turbines. To quantify their importance within the pelagic and benthic OM pools of OWFs ecosystems, it is essential to develop tracers for FP of the dominant species and other contributors (phyto-, zooplankton, and bacteria-degraded OM). We incubated the three species of interest in controlled lab conditions to harvest species-specific FP. We then analyzed the δ<sup>15</sup>N signal of the individual AA in these FP, and the other components of the marine OM pool, to develop a Compound-Specific Stable Isotope Analysis of amino acids (CSSIA–AA) fingerprint. Through multivariate techniques, the AAs with the strongest discriminating power between the potential sources are identified.

A quantitative framework for the phenomenon.","Nutrient availability is a crucial control on the growth and activity of marine microbes. Historically, nutrient limitations have been considered individually, however there is a growing appreciation that marine microbes can be limited by multiple nutrients simultaneously (nutrient colimitation). This raises the question: In nature, is nutrient colimitation an exception, or a rule? Current interpretations of this phenomenon are limited due to poor understandings of how nutrient colimitation affects microbial growth, physiology, and evolution. Here we introduce an expanded framework for quantifying the extent of nutrient colimitation, allowing us to test the hypothesis of colimitation against the traditional, Liebig view. We provide high-throughput growth data demonstrating that clonal bacterial populations experience colimitation for two independent, essential macronutrients (Type I colimitation). We then expand upon this framework to understand how evolution can spontaneously drive nutrient uptake to match environmental stoichiometry, leading to co-limitation by multiple nutrients. This process occurs in single species populations and in cross-feeding communities; in the latter, evolution shifts the dynamics of competition and cooperation between species.&nbsp;This prediction is consistent with the observed correspondence between elemental composition of microbes and their environments, and suggests that evolution makes colimitation a generic property of microbial populations, particularly in the oceans.&nbsp;",0,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Sala Portixol 1,

Using observations from the subtropical Mediterranean Sea we demonstrate that the subduction of water at ocean fronts generates subsurface intrusions with uncharacteristically high carbon, chlorophyll, and oxygen. These intrusions are identified as secondary maxima in contiguous vertical profiles of chlorophyll fluorescence, particle backscatter and oxygen and are enriched in heterotrophic bacteria and “fresh” picophytoplankton. We use 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing combined with flow cytometry to demonstrate that the community composition within intrusions resembles that of the photic zone region where the water originated. Though sinking is recognized as the primary mechanism for export of POC, we find that subduction and advection within intrusions delivers a different nutritional character to the mesopelagic than sinking particles and is particularly relevant when small phytoplankton dominate the community.

Several solute binding proteins (SBPs) of ABC transporters encoded in the genome of&nbsp;<em>R. euintracellularis</em>&nbsp;HH01 were expressed in&nbsp;<em>E. coli&nbsp;</em>and their substrates were characterized. The selected SBPs directly linked the host as the source of several substrates, e.g., sugars (sucrose, galactose), amino acids (glutamate, phenylalanine) and a polyamine (spermidine), to support the cyanobacterial symbiont. The importance of these proteins was also confirmed by estimating gene expression in wild populations of&nbsp;<em>H. hauckii</em>&nbsp;collected from the western tropical North Atlantic.

Controlled lab experiments offer the ability to advance understanding of the specificity, stability, and dynamics of microbe-to-microbe interactions, but are often limited in the scope and range of conditions tested. To address this, we are developing and streamlining a high-throughput 96-well microcosm approach that facilitates varying numerous important ecologically relevant factors in a single experiment.

The supply of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from autotrophs, on the other hand, is controlled by the availability of productivity limiting nutrients, e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus (P). The balance/competition between carbon (C) and nutrient limitations can potentially affect the ecological functions of marine microbial communities. In this talk, we explore the possibility of an intracellular compound, polyphosphate (polyP), in regulating this balance. PolyP is a polymer of phosphate residues linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, known to be an energy and/or P source for polyP-accumulating organisms. We hypothesize that marine heterotrophic bacteria can cope with the limitation of DOC using dynamic metabolisms of polyP. Using laboratory experiments of pure bacterial culture and natural seawater communities, we show that DOC and inorganic phosphate supply can affect cellular polyP dynamics. PolyP is an energy storage for marine heterotrophic bacteria during C limitation rather than P storage, and the release of phosphate from polyP degradation can support ambient autotrophy.",7,616,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Like phytoplankton, marine heterotrophic bacteria have significant iron requirements. Most of this iron resides within the respiratory chain of these organisms, indicating a critical link between iron availability and carbon metabolism. Given this, understanding both the iron and carbon requirements of heterotrophic bacteria will be important in understanding the microbial turnover of organic matter and the balance between export and remineralization in the marine environment. Here, we present results from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) investigating relationships between iron and carbon utilization by the heterotrophic bacterial community at the base of the euphotic zone. We find that with increased carbon availability, the total iron demand of the heterotrophic community increases and results in increased turnover rates of dissolved iron, with the potential for iron-limiting conditions to develop. Iron additions to these communities increase rates of bacterial production and respiration but generally yield lower bacterial growth efficiencies. We conclude that there is a tight coupling between the acquisition of iron and carbon by marine bacteria in the mesopelagic waters of the NPSG with the potential for iron availability to impact the efficiency of the biological carbon pump through the reorganization of heterotrophic carbon metabolism under low iron conditions.",2,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Portixol 1,

Deep learning approaches, in contrast, can learn useful representations of sequences based on the sequence context itself, for <em>every </em>sequence, without reference to external databases or need for metagenomic assembly. We are using deep learning approaches to link <em>all </em>microbial information from environmental metagenomes to the functional potential and ecosystem function of microbiomes, and developing strategies to overcome the high-dimensionality, low-sample-size problem inherent to biology.

Despite their importance, little is known about their global biogeography and diversity since global studies have been hampered by scarce data observations within the marine environment. This limitation prevents us from understanding the link between diazotroph richness and ecosystem function, especially nitrogen fixation as this is the main bioavailable nitrogen source in oligotrophic oceans. &nbsp; To analyse the correlation between global richness and nitrogen fixation rates, we integrate -omics and traditional microscopic based observations and make use of Species Distribution Models that have been developed to cope with datasets that suffer from uneven sampling efforts and scarce observations. &nbsp; Global diazotroph richness is generally high in subtropical and tropical marine regions declining polewards. Our results show that sea surface temperature (mean adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.17) and nutrient-related environmental parameters (mean adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.11 - 0.14) rank as the most important predictors on a global scale and biogeographic pattern strongly overlap in tropical regions supporting concepts such as niche complementarity. Additionally, we provide the first global biogeographic pattern of non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs that show increased probability of occurrences within upwelling regions when contrasted to cyanobacterial diazotrophs. This result further links to the hypothesized niche of non cyanobacterial diazotrophs to be found in nutrient rich waters containing higher concentrations of particulate organic carbon, where oxygen poor microniches provide a sheltered environment for the oxygen sensitive nitrogenase enzyme.

Recent studies also suggest that the recalcitrant fraction of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool may act as an important carbon sink in the oceans. However, the ultimate fate of DOC released by vegetated coastal communities is still largely unknown. Moreover, global change could alter both DOC fluxes and its bioavailability affecting the carbon sequestration capacity of coastal vegetated communities. This study explores, in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer), the effects of an <em>in situ</em> simulated marine heatwave (MHW) on carbon metabolism and DOC fluxes produced by a seagrass (<em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>) and a macroalga (<em>Caulerpa prolifera</em>) community.

The seagrass community exported similar fractions of labile and recalcitrant DOC, whereas <em>C. prolifera</em> exported mainly recalcitrant DOC. Finally, we demonstrated that temperature increases the fraction of recalcitrant DOC produced by these vegetated coastal communities.

The years of 2015 and 2019 were marked by high stratification, elevated temperatures and high potential for organic carbon export (i.e., elevated net community production during the productive season). In 2015, particulate organic carbon (POC) accumulation in the euphotic zone (Ez) was modest and did not correlate with elevated productivity. However, significant POC accumulated as a feature in the mesopelagic and persisted for most of the year. After 2018, the system became more productive as seen in chlorophyll and POC timeseries. In 2019, elevated POC accumulation was observed within Ez, and subsequent export and persistence in the mesopelagic was similar to 2015. In both years, phytoplankton community composition changed and became dominated by chlorophytes and haptophytes. We pose that fast particle sinking happened due to an increase of zooplankton fecal pellets and/or high phytoplankton mortality due to temperature stress above physiological tolerance. POC persistence in the mesopelagic happened due to disaggregation of small particles into smaller particles, becoming too small for gravitational sinking, or due to incomplete microbial respiration.

Combining field surveys with experiments in controlled conditions allowed to characterize spatial variability in responses to thermal stress among species, populations and individuals. However, the temporal variability in this response remains poorly known. Thus, we replicated common garden experiments (control vs. thermal stress) during three consecutive years (2015-2017) using the same individuals from three populations of the habitat-forming octocoral <em>Paramuricea clavata</em>. We found that the average percentage of tissue necrosis per population during the experiment significantly variated across years. This result was due to the decrease in the probability of survival in 2017 when a severe MHWs was observed in the study area. Furthermore, we genotyped all individuals with 14 microsatellites to define the genetic framework of the study and found that populations were genetically differentiated, but their respective levels of genetic isolation were similar and not related to mean tissue necrosis. At individual level, we tested for the occurrence of heterosis. Overall, our data characterize in detail the temporal variability in the response to thermal stress showing that this response may: i) critically driven by summer conditions and ii) under stronger influence of environmental factors compared to genetics. These results unambiguously question the potential adaptation of <em>P. clavata </em>to on-going warming trend.",4,631,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

There is already well-established evidence linking MHW with reductions in biodiversity and mass mortalities in some coastal ecosystems (e.g. seagrass beds). However, the effects of MHW on mesozooplankton communities is yet to be fully quantified. Mesozooplankton play an essential role in the transfer of energy from primary producers to higher trophic levels in the pelagic habitat; hence, any response to MHW is likely to have far-reaching impacts on the pelagic ecosystem. Here, we quantified responses to MHWs exhibited by mesozooplankton communities in German Bight, applying a modified BACI (before-after control-impact) design to the plankton time series of the Helgoland Roads (43 years of sampling, three times per week, from 1975 to 2018). Changes in the mesozooplankton community in association to MHWs were particularly pronounced during spring (e.g. shifts in community composition, drops in copepod evenness). Densities of 7 taxa decreased or increased in association to the MHW. Responses were less pronounced for summer and autumn MHW while no evidence of responses were present in winter, except for a sharp decline in cyclopoid density. These results highlight the potential impacts of MHW on mesozooplankton communities and coastal ecosystems. Better understanding of the consequences of MHW will require further monitoring in connection with research on the mechanisms driving the observed mesozooplankton responses.",2,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza A,

Sessile animals and macroalgae may be particularly vulnerable to anomalous warming given constraints in resource acquisition and reproduction imposed by sessility. In temperate reef ecosystems, sessile suspension feeding invertebrates are a critical trophic link between the plankton and the benthos, and along with macroalgae, provide food for an array of mobile species. Using 14 years of seasonal benthic community data across five coastal reefs, we evaluated how communities of sessile invertebrates and understory macroalgae in southern California kelp forests responded to the “Blob” marine heat wave, a period of anomalously high temperatures and low phytoplankton production. We show that this event had prolonged consequences for kelp forest ecosystems including reductions in sessile invertebrate cover and species richness. Changes to community structure of invertebrates and macroalgae, including species invasions, have persisted six years post-Blob, suggesting that a climate-driven shift in California kelp forests is underway.",3,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza A,

Seagrass die-offs and associated ecological consequences are increasingly observed, and one of the largest pacific marine heatwaves (MHWs) on record is temporally correlated with die-offs in estuaries of the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This relationship makes temperature a particularly important stressor to investigate with respect to species resilience. MHWs of greater frequency, intensity, and length are predicted, which may compromise the future of eelgrass populations by impacting eelgrass health, survival, and recovery.&nbsp;We&nbsp;conducted a germination experiment to evaluate the effects of thermal stress on germination, growth, and development under simulated MHW scenarios of the same cumulative intensity but differing in severity and duration. We hypothesize that above ambient temperatures will increase seedling respiration rate and sediment porewater sulfide concentrations, both with implications for seedling health. The&nbsp;high severity MHW scenario will lead to greater seedling respiration and a presumably greater carbon deficit. Results from this experiment will help define how future predicted warming scenarios affect the vulnerable early life stages of&nbsp;<em>Z. marina&nbsp;</em>and the mechanisms impacting seedling physiology.

These MHWs are strongly affecting habitat-building macroinvertebrates, seriously endangering high-diverse habitats such as coralligenous assemblages. While the impact of MHWs on key species such as the red gorgonian (<em>Paramuricea clavata</em>) and on their associated communities is becoming increasingly described, much is still unknown regarding the differential responses associated to different coralligenous assemblages. Likewise, the role of different protection levels and thermic regimes remains unexplored. Finally, even though the red gorgonian's key role has been extensively theorized and agreed upon, the indirect impact of MHWs on these communities as a result of the loss of <em>P. clavata</em> is not well quantified at relevant spatial scales. To explore some of these questions, we propose a framework that uses trait-based approaches studying both the red gorgonian and their understory community allowing us to track changes in the coralligenous structure and their functioning. For this purpose, we benefit from long-term <em>P. clavata </em>demographic and community data from different Marine Protected Areas in the NW Mediterranean Sea.

Extreme climatic events, such as marine heat waves (MHWs), are increasing in frequency and severity year after year, causing mass mortality events for many species. Coralligenous assemblages, one of the most important habitats in the Mediterranean rocky bottoms, are strongly affected by raising temperatures. These&nbsp;complex habitats foster up to 10% of the Mediterranean biodiversity, and many of them are dominated by the octocoral <em>Paramuricea clavata</em>. Despite the increase of MHWs, <em>P. clavata</em> populations in the Medes Islands Marine Reserve (NW Mediterranean) were showing some resilience to these changing conditions. However, the summer of 2022 was exceptionally warm in this area. From July to November, a total of 50 days of MHWs were registered, one of the largest events ever recorded. In this study, we assessed the impacts of the MHWs that occurred between 2016 and 2022 in the <em>P. clavata</em> populations from the Medes Islands. The 2022 heat wave dramatically impacted <em>P. clavata</em> populations, affecting up to 93% of the colonies in one of the studied sites. Although previous MHWs have already triggered mortality events in this area, none of them has been as severe as the one in 2022. The significant impacts documented here raise concerns about the future of shallow <em>P. clavata</em> populations across the Mediterranean, suggesting that the resilience of this species may not be maintained to sustain these populations in the face of climate change.",1,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Ibiza A,

When predicting species’&nbsp; responses to warming, species are typically considered as physiologically homogeneous. Yet, responses to extreme events may vary according to differences in phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation across the range of a species. Using a common-garden mesocosm experiment, we compared the resilience (i.e., response to and recovery from) to two warming events of different intensity on seagrass seedlings germinated from seeds collected at eight regions across the species’ distribution range. We show a positive relationship between resilience to warming and local thermal variability, suggesting seagrass evolutionary adaptation to local thermal conditions. Our results highlight the critical importance of incorporating intra-specific variability when making predictions and when developing conservation and restoration strategies about species vulnerability to climate change. Furthermore, strong negative lag-effects on seedlings performance were observed after the warming phase had already stopped, highlighting the importance of following species’ responses after a disturbance has finished, particularly because most experimental studies have only examined immediate, short-term, responses to stressors. Given the long-term common-garden approach used, we expect that differences in seedling responses will be mainly the result of genetic changes leading to local adaptation.",4,,6/6/23 8:30,6/6/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza A,

Within Swedish waters, an example of a sensitive species with reduced resilience is the Atlantic cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>). This species has been subject to overfishing, and with additional pressures such as habitat degradation and changing environmental conditions there has been little to no recovery seen, despite more than a decade of management efforts. Given the historical ecological, economical, and cultural significance of this species, it is important to understand how Atlantic cod respond to global climate change in order to successfully and sustainably manage this species in the future. Here, a multi-stressor experiment was conducted to evaluate physiological responses of juvenile cod exposed to a heat wave, ocean acidification, and freshening (reduced salinity). The physiological response to single drivers showed variable effects and exposure to multiple stressors resulted in a significantly increased standard metabolic rate, as well as increased levels of activity in liver proteins, indicating signs of oxidative stress. Importantly, two separate responses (heightened or reduced stress) were seen within a single treatment, which was correlated to genotype. The coastal ecotype, had a reduced stress response while the offshore ecotype, originating in Skagerrak North Sea, a heighted response.

The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events like heatwaves presents severe short-term challenges to aquatic biota. The ecological consequences of these events will depend in part on the relative effect acute heat stress has on different species; comparisons between thermal performance curves (TPCs) can yield important insights about relative vulnerability to heatwaves. Understanding the mechanisms underlying variation in TPCs (e.g. genetic variation and acclimation effects) is also important for predicting vulnerability in a changing ocean. Planktonic organisms may be particularly strongly affected by heatwaves. By nature of their short generation times, however, these taxa may also be able to respond rapidly to changes in temperature via both plasticity and selection on standing genetic variation. Here we examined how vulnerability to heatwaves varies seasonally in two key estuarine copepod species,&nbsp;<em>Acartia hudsonica</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>A. tonsa</em>. We show that different levels of intra-annual variation in TPCs shape differing patterns in seasonal vulnerability to heatwaves in these two species, with stronger variation in A. tonsa resulting in reduced overall vulnerability.

The recent development of purified indicator dyes greatly improved the accuracy of spectrophotometric pH measurements by removing interfering impurities that cause large pH-dependent biases in pH. However, some batches of purified indicators still contain significant residual impurities that lead to an unacceptably large bias in pH for oceanic measurements. We developed a model to detect impurities in mCP using a variant of the classification technique Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA). The classification model was trained with pure mCP spectra (350-750 nm) at pH 12 and tested on independent samples of mCP with varying levels of impurities (determined by HPLC) and measured on two different spectrophotometers. All the dyes identified as pure by the SIMCA model were sufficiently low in residual impurities that their biases in pH were &lt;0.002 in buffered artificial seawater solutions. Laboratories can apply our model by&nbsp;measuring a small number of instrument standardization and model validation samples. We propose that this method be applied for verifying that residual impurities in batches of purified <em>m</em>CP do not significantly bias pH measurements and that this method represents a key step in the development of a measurement quality framework necessary to attain the uncertainty goals articulated by the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON) for “climate quality” measurements (i.e., 0.003 in pH).",1,638,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Although OA trends and the resulting biological impacts are likely exacerbated in the semi-enclosed and highly populated Mediterranean Sea, some fundamental knowledge gaps still exist. These gaps are at tributed to both the uneven capacity for OA research that exists between Mediterranean countries, as well as to the subtle and long-term biological, physical and chemical interactions that define OA impacts. In this paper, we systematically analyzed the different aspects of OA research in the Mediterranean region based on two sources: the United Nation’s International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Ocean Acidification International Coordination Center (OA-ICC) database, and an extensive survey. Our analysis shows that 1) there is an uneven geographic capacity in OA research, and illustrates that both the Algero-Provencal and Ionian sub-basins are currently the least studied Mediterranean areas, 2) the carbonate system is still poorly quantified in coastal zones, and long-term time-series are still sparse across the Mediterranean Sea, which is a challenge for studying its variability and assessing coastal OA trends, 3) the most studied groups of organisms are autotrophs (algae, phanerogams, phytoplankton), mollusks, and corals, while microbes, small mollusks (mainly pteropods), and sponges are among the least studied, 4) there is an overall paucity in socio-economic, paleontological, and modeling studies in the Mediterranean Sea, and 5) in spite of general resource availability and the agreement for improved and coordinated OA governance, there is a lack of consistent OA policies in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to highlighting the current status, trends and gaps of OA research, this work also provides recommendations, based on both our literature assessment and a survey that targeted the Mediterranean OA scientific community.

As global change progresses, and our ocean becomes more acidic and warmer, there is potential that these changes to the abiotic environment can act in concert to disrupt both individuals and species interactions. Interactions that play an important role in shaping ecosystem structure and function include those between consumers and their resources. The consequences of physiological changes will be particularly notable where the consumer affected connects different trophic levels, as is the case for marine invertebrate herbivores. Given the importance of these organisms, there is an emerging body of literature considering the responses of invertebrate herbivores to ocean acidification and warming, which I will share a review of here. I will also discuss a manipulative experiment conducted in Hong Kong which quantified the responses of herbivores to ocean acidification and warming, both in isolation and combination. Together, the literature review and experimental outcomes highlight that while we can try to draw generalizations, the exact responses observed will likely be context-specific (e.g., to a particular location, feeding group, combination of environmental conditions altered).

Subsurface scallop habitats in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic already experience suboptimal temperature and carbonate chemistry conditions episodically. Future projections indicate that conditions in the Gulf of Maine will begin to surpass suboptimal thresholds persistently by the year 2050. Here, we project the effects of ocean acidification (OA) and warming on sea scallop growth and reproduction historically and over the next century using a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model forced by a regional ocean model. Preliminary results suggest that end-of-century OA and warming, together, will cause sea scallops to grow faster but reach a smaller maximum size.

To evaluate the potential side effects of OAE, we tested the impact of a wide range of alkalinity (e.g. ranging from 1500 to 4000 mmole Kg<sup>-1</sup>) on the early life stages of three different species of echinoderms (sea urchins and brittlestars) in two different regions (North Atlantic and Mediterranean).

Recent marine heat waves and increased concentrations of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> causing ocean acidification (OA) are two major stressors that have been associated with widespread changes in global marine ecosystems. On coral reefs, mass bleaching events resulting from high temperatures have been common, but the effects of OA on this system have remained subtle, even though the long-term potentially are very serious. As the physical structure and function of coral reefs from which humans draw resources from are rapidly changing due to human impacts, it remains unknown whether established reefs have the potential to resist climate change stressors. As such, we initiated the present study to understanding how coral reefs that are recovering from disturbances, and therefore are dominated by communities of small corals, would be differentially impacted by OA relative to the effects on established communities composed of larger corals. We expand on previous FOCE studies with greater replication and a temporally-replicated experimental design, also employing manipulation in coral size structure to test for size-dependency of coral colonies in response to OA. Our results indicate that metabolic function of coral communities composed of small colonies (i.e., ≤ 5 cm) will be disproportionately impacted in negative ways by OA (i.e.,&nbsp; at a <em>p</em>CO2 of ~1000 µatm) and transition from net accretion to net dissolution. Community metabolism of large corals (i.e., ≥ 10 cm) were still depressed in response to OA, but were overall still net positive, suggesting more established communities of living coral communities have an increased capacity to buffer against OA effects. These results highlight the complexities of scaling results of OA experiments from individual corals to whole communities, but they also highlight the crucial need to limit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to protect these valuable ecosystems.",1,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Menorca A,

Global ocean warming and acidification interact with local coastal acidification and eutrophication on the coral reef at Kahekili Beach Park on the west coast of Maui, Hawai’i. The nearby Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility (LWRF) injects millions of gallons daily of treated wastewater into Maui’s groundwater system. This wastewater-groundwater mixture enters the ocean as submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) that is characterized as low pH, high-nutrient, and low salinity. Since the 1980s, negative effects of the polluted SGD have been recorded along the Kahekili coral reef where SGD seeps are located, including increased algal cover, harmful algal blooms, decreased grazer populations, decreased coral coverage, and increased bioerosion. In addition, the low pH of SGD has been shown to enhance acidification and lead to net dissolution of calcium carbonate. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a mandatory visitor quarantine in Hawai’i resulted in a severe reduction in tourism, decreasing the state’s population by about half. The volume of wastewater injected by LWRF also decreased by roughly half and we observed a significant decrease in nitrate concentration and acidification (i.e., increased pH) at and near the Kahekili SGD seeps.

In addition to discrete laboratory-based measurements being taken on research cruises in-situ sensors are deployed to measure the numerous CO2-system parameters. This creates a need to ‘intercalibrate’ or validate the various types of data, especially in the case of overdetermined datasets where more than two CO2-system parameters are measured. Understanding the concentrations and associated uncertainties of the parameters rely on calculations of the CO2-system of seawater computed by solvers such as CO2SYS (Lewis and Wallace, 1998). A key drawback to the publicly available solvers is, despite the ever-increasing number of overdetermined datasets and measurements, the solvers themselves can only calculate and propagate errors in an exactly determined system–wherein two of the measured parameters are input. In this poster we present QUODcarb, a novel approach to solving the CO2-system equations in a way that can handle more than two measured input parameters.

However, their combined and long-term effects in bryozoans remain poorly understood although many species provide ecosystem services and goods. Here we examine the long-term effects of increased ocean warming and its interaction with acidification on populations of an encrusting and erect bryozoan species and their associated microbiome that naturally occur in CO<sub>2</sub> vents in the Mediterranean Sea. Both species showed an increase of carbonate skeleton thickness, likely due to the energy reallocation to calcification under low pH conditions. However, the proportion of cover of the encrusting species decreased from 2016 to 2020 at a CO<sub>2</sub> vent and non-acidified sites and this trend was even more negative at the acidified site. Our findings suggest the increasing seawater temperature in the last decade combined with acidified conditions have accelerated the mortality rates in the incrusting species, also shifting its microbiome towards the dominance of anaerobic microbial taxa. Microbial genera known to have essential functions to the host such as biosynthesis of defense compounds or thermal protection were also depleted in both bryozoan species under such conditions, which may have reduced their resilience to acidification. Both species may thus be particularly at risk to synergistic impacts of both warming and acidification regardless of their higher investment in calcification.

At the central-northern Chilean coast, there is the national reserve Pingüino de Humboldt involving marine reserves in three small islands (Choros, Damas y Chañaral de Aceituno). The reserve was declared in 1990 becoming part of the National System of Protected Areas, having a management plan (Decree No. 159) since 2016 aimed at promoting scientific knowledge to generate baseline information for the conservation, management and marine exploitation of the natural resources of the marine reserve. However, till now, little is known about hydrographic and oceanographic processes regulating the productivity and biodiversity of the marine reserve, especially on basal trophic groups like plankton species. This information is critical to design the management and conservation efforts besides elucidating adaptive processes determining the tolerance to current and future environmental changes. The marine reserve is affected year-round by coastal upwelling promoting the irruption of cold, oxygen-poor and CO<sub>2</sub> rich (&gt;800 µatm) subsurface waters. While oxygen deficient water might impact aerobic metabolism, high acidity water might constrain the metabolism of calcifying organisms and hence, the efficiency of the biological pump supporting higher trophic levels. Furthermore, the region is also affected by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which, through high temperature waters, can synergistically impact basal biological processes supporting the biodiversity of the reserve. By means of discrete oceanographic campaigns and continuous measurements of temperature, oxygen, pH and salinity at two depths, the ENSO-Climate Change and the Carbon cycle in the Pacific South East (ECLIPSE) project is devoted to characterize the interannual pH variability in the marine reserve, as well as delineate biological responses to current and future progression of ocean acidification. Here we show preliminary results corresponding to eight months of observations during a period dominated by La Niña. Quality control tests and validation with reference material and higher accuracy measurements of pH, oxygen and salinity were carried before analysis. Stronger changes on hydrographic drivers occurred beyond the diurnal cycle such that under active upwelling, the marine reserve is exposed at either the surface (10 m) or depth (30 m) to pH levels as low as 7.77 and 7.62 pH<sub>T</sub>, respectively. Periods with low pH conditions can last up to ten days, and variability and magnitude of pH changes are attenuated with depth. Low pH events were also associated (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.6) with cold (12°C) and hypoxic (&lt;1 mg/L) conditions suggesting upwelling might be the main local forcing of hydrographic fluctuations affecting the marine reserve.

Here we present results of a large-scale study of ecosystem metabolism across a wide range of boreal rivers draining the eastern James Bay. We deployed optical dissolved oxygen and temperature loggers in 12 large to medium rivers (Strahler order 5 to 8) over a 4 month-period (June-October 2019), and then modelled GPP and ER using the stream Metabolizer R package. These probes were deployed at the same location as the pre-established hydrometric stations so that we have coupled estimates of discharge and metabolic rates. Our results show much lower GPP than ER rates for all rivers, confirming that riverine metabolism is consistently net heterotrophic and a net source of CO<sub>2</sub> that fuels riverine supersaturation. There were major differences among rivers in GPP, ER and the balance between the two. These metabolic data were combined with ambient gas fluxes to determine the balance between external and internal sources sustaining CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in these boreal rivers, and the role of GPP in modulating these fluxes.

Within river corridors the different ecosystem compartments (e.g. river channels, freshwater and saline wetlands, estuaries) process carbon and nitrogen at varying rates. Despite the recognised importance of river corridors in the turnover of allochthonous and autochthonous material, drivers of biogeochemical processes in these systems remain poorly understood. One such driver is temperature, which is globally increasing with large implications for aquatic biogeochemistry. The many experimental and modelling studies investigating the impacts of temperature on biogeochemical turnover usually assume Arrhenius equation to best represent the relationship between temperature and processing rates, without critical analysis of its suitability. We present results from a meta-analysis of studies focussing on metabolic and greenhouse gas responses to temperature where non-linear temperature controls were used. A diverse range of freshwater aquatic systems were investigated including rivers (surface water and sediments), lakes (surface water and sediments) and wetlands. We find that, dependent on ecosystem compartment and greenhouse gas, the Arrhenius model does not always provide the best fit to the data and therefore, biogeochemical responses to temperature changes should not be assumed a priori to follow Arrhenius equation.

Until now, research on the carbon (C) cycle in inland waters mostly focused on flooded areas, neglecting the role of dry riverbeds in biogeochemical processes. Recent studies have shown that dry riverbeds can contribute significantly to carbon fluxes in aquatic systems.

The unexplained CO<sub>2</sub> could be attributed to the equilibria between CO<sub>2</sub> and the carbonate buffering system, which is seldom integrated into CO<sub>2</sub> budgets, let alone its interplay with metabolism on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Here, we perform a process-based mass balance modeling analysis based on an 8-year monitored dataset from two adjacent reservoirs with similar catchment sizes but contrasting trophic states and alkalinity. We find that in addition to the well-acknowledged driver of net metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> production, carbonate buffering also determines the total amount and seasonal dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the reservoirs. Carbonate buffering can contribute up to 50% of whole-reservoir CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, by converting the ionic forms of carbonate to CO<sub>2</sub>. This results in similar seasonal CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from reservoirs with differing trophic state, even in low alkalinity system. We predict that changes in land use and drought would affect reservoir CO<sub>2</sub> emissions not only by ecosystem metabolism but also by carbonate buffering triggered by increased dissolved inorganic carbon import from catchments. Our model approach highlights the important role of carbonate buffering and metabolism that generate and remove CO<sub>2</sub> throughout the reservoirs on a seasonal scale.

The gas transfer velocity describes the rate at which gases move across the water surface. To measure this parameter directly, a tracer gas (often propane) is diffused into a stream and measured at two known distances downstream–the change in concentration between the two points can be used to calculate the gas transfer velocity. Yet the use of tracer gases such as propane is challenging because of (1) the inability to monitor the gas injection continuously, and (2) the reliance on empirically derived coefficients for conversion calculations. Here, we assess the use of carbon dioxide as an alternative tracer gas to estimate the gas transfer velocity of a low-alkalinity tropical stream, and compare these estimates to those based on the more traditional propane. In parallel, we also test the ability of existing empirical models to predict the gas transfer velocity. We show an overall agreement between the two gas tracers, while empirical models tend to overestimate (underestimate) the gas transfer velocity under low (high) flow conditions. We illustrate the added value of collecting high frequency dissolved carbon dioxide concentrations prior to, during and after tracer gas experiments and discuss the potential of these data to shed further light on in-stream gas exchange processes.&nbsp;",1,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Sala Portixol 1,

We used bi-weekly grab samples throughout the open water season, in combination with groundwater samples, to map lateral fluxes and pinpoint the contributors of CO<sub>2</sub> evasion from a 400 m boreal stream reach. At the spatial scale, we established five sampling stations every 100 m along the study reach. We used mass-balance to identify the proportion of external input vs. internal production of CO<sub>2 </sub>supporting CO<sub>2</sub> evasion. Because the stream is mire fed, we could see clear trends of decreasing CO<sub>2</sub> and DOC concentrations with increasing distance from the mire outlet. During high-flow, upstream input rather than internal production fuelled CO<sub>2</sub> evasion compared to baseflow, when contribution of groundwater supply and internal production to CO<sub>2</sub> evasion increased. Additionally, stream morphology played an important role during base-flow conditions, where local features and especially groundwater input contribution to CO<sub>2</sub> evasion increased.

The hydrological patterns had a strong influence on the export rate of carbon via the watershed outflow, with low C export during the base flow summer period and extremely high export fluxes during peak spring discharge periods.

However, they are particularly vulnerable to an increase in intensity and frequency of heat waves. To investigate the impact of heatwaves on benthic metabolism of the intertidal zone of the Guadalquivir Estuary (SW Spain), sediment cores were subjected to a range of temperatures (10&amp;ordm;C to 42&amp;ordm;C) for 4 days followed by a 7-day recovery period. Oxygen microprofiles and whole core incubations were performed daily to measure benthic metabolism (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nutrients fluxes (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).

However, at the highest temperatures, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption decreased 40% within two days, probably due to an exhaustion of the available labile organic matter, being lower than background rates after the recovery period.

Prolonged periods of drought, associated with reduced rainfall and consequent decrease in freshwater flow, can promote the extension of saltwater intrusions into upper estuarine reaches, impacting oligohaline and freshwater estuarine communities. This study aimed to assess the impact of a ca. 2-year drought period on phytoplankton biomass and structure in the Guadiana estuary (SE Portugal/SW Spain). Environmental and phytoplankton data were sampled (period: 2000-2022) at three estuarine areas: tidal freshwater zone (upper estuary), estuarine turbidity maximum (middle estuary), and marine estuarine zone (lower estuary). Data were aggregated into two specific hydrological stages: before drought (2000-2013), and during drought (2021-2022). An increase in salinity was observed, at all estuarine stations, during the drought period. A decrease in diatom abundance at the tidal freshwater zone, but an increase in the middle and lower estuarine reaches were detected during this period. Overall, other phytoplankton groups, namely chlorophytes, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria, declined in all estuarine locations during the drought period, whereas dinoflagellates increased in the marine estuarine zone.

Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes due to their low thermal inertia. In these areas, microphytobenthos (MPB) contributes significantly to primary production, being an important carbon source for the higher trophic levels. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations and heatwaves on the abundance and productivity of MPB. Sediment cores sampled in the Guadalquivir River salt marshes (SW Spain) were exposed for 7 days to different thermal regimes in the laboratory, i.e. constant (20 deg), low (20-28 deg) and high daily fluctuation (20-34 deg). O2 microprofiles and light reflectance were measured every 30 minutes and used to estimate the net community production (NCP) and the MPB migration patterns, respectively. Our results show that even at constant temperatures, NCP and reflectance vary during the day, with no relevant changes over the course of a week. Under temperature fluctuations, NCP increases with increasing temperature during the day, but decreases overall after three days exposed to a simulated heatwave. Similarly, the migration pattern of MPB remained constant at constant temperature, whereas higher temperatures decreased the surface reflectance, suggesting that the MPB community moved away from the surface. Heat waves could therefore have a major impact on the metabolism and functioning of intertidal areas, decreasing productivity, and altering MPB migration patterns",4,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Auditorium Mallorca,

However, they are often poorly recorded in surveys, they lack stock assessments, and fisheries data often ignores their taxonomic resolution. Thus, little effort has been made to understand cephalopod biomass and traits distribution at large-to-global scale. We perform a meta-analysis on survey data from European and North American waters to evaluate the biomass and traits distribution of cephalopods in relation to environmental conditions. We then contrast these results with global fisheries data. We find that the proportion of cephalopod biomass increases with temperature up to about 6% of total fish and cephalopod biomass. On the other hand, cephalopods tend to be smaller, shorter lived and with faster growth rates in warmer systems compared to colder ones. These results suggest that an increase in water temperature could lead to an increase of cephalopod biomass proportion in cold and temperate systems, particularly that of fast-growing cephalopods. Given that their growth rate is on average four times greater than that of fish, and therefore consume about four times more resources than fish, even a small increase in cephalopod biomass in these ecosystems could lead to a disproportionally large increase in resources consumption. Due to competition for resources with other fishes, such increase may lead to changes in the ecosystem structure and reduce total fisheries landings.",1,,6/9/23 15:00,6/9/23 16:30,Sala Portixol 2,

The Republic of Palau relies heavily on SSF for commercial, subsistence, and cultural purposes, with climate change already impacting marine resources. Ensuring the sustainability of Palauan SSF requires understanding the socio-ecological impacts of a warming climate, including the ability of fishers to adapt. This study couples (a) species distribution models to assess the projected impacts of climate change on critical offshore, reef, and invertebrate marine species (n = 63) and (b) three surveys conducted 2020-2022 (n = 445; n = 29; n = 23) to explore fisher perceptions, behavioral intentions, and adaptive capacity. Initial findings suggest that offshore fish will be more climate-resilient than reef fish and invertebrates. Surveys reveal that while fishing effort has increased over time, the catch volume has decreased. Most fishers believe climate change will negatively impact their fishing in the future, yet intend to adapt to remain within the fishery in response to scenarios of major climate-driven declines in catch. These results indicate that SSF may continue to be central to Palauan livelihoods despite climate-strained resources, underscoring the importance of sustainable, climate-resilient policy that engages fishers across various dimensions.

Specifically, we assess the impact of bottom trawling on predicted current distributions of deep-water corals and then assess the effectiveness of possible protection for protecting current predictions of deep-water corals, for providing habitat refugia under future climatic conditions, and the possible economic effects of marine protection on the fishery using a simple metric of fishing value. Bottom trawling was predicted to impact all taxa, but particularly reef-forming corals. Areas of core habitat were predicted to decrease under future climatic conditions for many taxa. We found that designing protection using current day predictions alone, having accounted for the impacts of historic fishing impacts, was unlikely to provide refugia for deep water-corals under future climate change. Areas which may provide climate refugia whilst still providing efficient protection for current distributions were identified.

While species targeted by SSF tend to be more vulnerable to shifts in climate than those targeted by demersal fisheries, seasonal diversification in species portfolio, through changes in use of type of fishing gear, increases the adaptive capacity of SSF to climate change and maintains stable economic incomes. However, fisheries diversification depends on species distribution and abundance, which may vary locally with contrasting ecological, and/or socio-economic factors. In the Balearic Islands, there has been a 50% decline in the number SSF vessels since 2005, but the combined impacts of this decline and climate change on species diversification and economic portfolio are unclear. Thus, we analysed spatio-temporal changes in species landings, stability in fishing incomes and levels of between-port connectivity to evaluate the adaptive capacity of Balearic SSF. Using multivariate and network analysis of daily landing data for 10 ports distributed across the Balearic Islands between 2007 and 2020, we found landing weight and revenue of dominant target species were stable; however, there were spatial and temporal fluctuations in species portfolio diversity, due to shifts in abundance of accessory species. Overall, these results may be used as an indicator of resilience for climate risk assessment of SSF in the Balearic Islands, and contribute to the identification of adaptative strategies to mitigate risks of biodiversity declines.",4,660,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In the ocean, the impacts of climate change on species’ movement have generally been evaluated near the surface, which could be important for species that live in the epipelagic zone (&lt;200 m) but they have been largely ignored in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones (below 200 m). Predicting the distribution shift of thousands of species is challenging, too. However, a simple yet powerful predictor of species distribution shifts is climate velocity, which estimates the speed and direction of isotherm movement under a changing climate and provides a generic expectation of species’ range shifts. Using climate velocity as a metric of potential range shifts, this work explores a central question in marine ecology: how can climate change be included in conservation science, especially considering the three-dimensional nature of the ocean? To this end, this work presents novel research in three main areas including: 1) how climate velocity can inform conservation actions; 2) how climate velocity changes across ocean depths layers, posing a challenge for marine protected area (MPA) design; and 3) how can we build conservation plans that consider the 3D nature of the ocean and the impacts of climate change.

Simultaneously, we computed climate velocity, based on the space-time variation of sea surface temperature. Subsequently, we modeled the space-time patterns in species distributions as responding to climate velocity, conditioned by the temperature and depth affinities of the species. Contrary to the generalized expectation of meridionalization of the Mediterranean communities., our results identify unexpected displacement towards the Southwest and shallower waters in many species. Generally, cold-water species (with an affinity for low and moderate mean temperature and wide and narrow temperature ranges), were better at tracking climate velocity. Further, species distributed over the continental shelf shifted towards shallower waters in response to higher climate velocity; something that also goes against <em>a-priori</em> expectations of shifts towards deeper, cooler waters under warming. Our results also found these species are expanding their ranges of dispersion and the spatial heterogeneity of their population structure, not explicitly in response to climate velocity.

Regime shifts occur when the resilience of a system is eroded, and typically imply hysteresis, a lacking or delayed system response when pressures are reverted, which can frustrate management and restoration efforts. Thus, estimating the resilience of fish communities to climate change is fundamental to build effective management strategies. Here we investigate whether the northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea) fish and macroinvertebrate community, depicted by commercial fishery landings, has undergone irreversible regime shifts over the last 40 years. We use a stochastic cusp model to show that, under the interactive effect of fishing and warming (resulting from Climate Change) the community reorganized through discontinuous changes. Moreover, this model can also estimate the resilience of the community and shows that part of the community has now reached a new stable and resilient state, implying that a recovery towards previous baselines might be impossible due to Climate Change. This is crucial for the fisheries which exploit these areas. Interestingly, total landings from the fishing vessels remained constant across decades, masking the structural changes that were occurring in the community due to the combined drivers.

In this work, we use a set of 404 surveys conducted in 2018, to we explore how male and female fishers are differently exposed to the challenges of climate change. The results, based on diversity indexes of the portfolio show that female fishers are highly exposed to climate change due to a less diverse portfolio than men. This pattern is observed across the entire coast of Galicia.

Coastal sediments are responsible for the removal of ~150 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup> globally through the burial of particulate organic matter. Additionally, coastal sediments are natural sources of alkalinity and generate ~30 Teq alkalinity yr<sup>-1 </sup>globally, which is equivalent to an uptake of ~300 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup> from the atmosphere. Frequent trawling in coastal waters directly disturbs this natural carbon sink. While many research efforts have focused on the impact of trawling on organic carbon burial in coastal sediments, the impact on sedimentary alkalinity generation has not been quantified. Here, we present biogeochemical model simulations of the impact of bottom trawling on sedimentary alkalinity generation. In an undisturbed sediment, over half of the alkalinity is generated by the dissolution of carbonate minerals, with the remainder linked to denitrification and pyrite precipitation. Bottom trawling reduces the alkalinity efflux by ~10% at 1-3 disturbance events per year, and by up to ~60% &nbsp;at 10 disturbance events per year. Most of this alkalinity loss is caused by the reoxidation of pyrite. The reduction in natural alkalinity generation due to trawling corresponds to an estimated anthropogenic decrease in the oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake of 30 – 180 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup>. These results show that the impact of trawling on sedimentary alkalinity generation likely is larger than its impact on organic carbon sequestration.",3,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Palma,

To understand the spatiotemporal variability, sources, composition and reactivity of OC in marine sediments, a curated and harmonized database of OC content and associated parameters is needed, especially considering the logistical challenges and costs of retrieving samples at sea. This has prompted the development of the Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC) database. Here we present an updated version, MOSAIC v.2.0, which stores variables such as OC content, its isotopic composition (&amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), sedimentological parameters (e.g., grain size, mineral surface area), and associated molecular signatures (e.g., lignin, fatty acid, alkane biomarkers). MOSAIC v.2.0 offers a broad spatiotemporal coverage, with data from more than 17’000 individual sediment cores collected since the 1950s, providing a key tool to assess natural and anthropogenic controls on marine sediments. Initial applications of MOSAIC (v.2.0) to understand spatial patterns in the geochemical composition of marine sediment on regional and global scales will also be illustrated.",0,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Palma,

These play a key role in transporting organic carbon (OC) and nutrients from the continents to the coastal ocean and structuring coastal ecosystems in space and time. In the context of climate change, these events could intensify and be more frequent, implying an additional pressure on coastal ecosystems, but the response of benthic biogeochemical processes is still poorly known. To address this issue, bi-monthly winter cruises were conducted in fall-winter 2021-2022 at one station located in the vicinity of the Rhône River mouth (NW Mediterranean Sea). Sediment cores and porewaters were sampled to analyse dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Following the main winter flood, a large deposit of 24 cm was observed. The reorganization of porewater composition and the influence of biogeochemical processes after the flood deposition were analysed. An early diagenetic model (FeSDIA) was used to calculate biogeochemical rates and fluxes. The results showed an intensification of sulfate reduction in the newly deposited layer below the sediment surface, whereas anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) intensified at depth below the former buried interface. We report the first biweekly time series of solid and porewater composition coupled to the use of a numerical model of early diagenetic processes in the surface sediment of a deltaic environment which enables the quantification of biogeochemical dynamics after a flood deposit.",4,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Palma,

River flooding can deliver a large amount of sediment to the depositional center at the river-sea interface over a short period of time. Because of its irregularity and unpredictability, these episodic events are rarely captured in both observational campaigns and current models. Using the Rhône prodelta as a case study, we present recent advances in understanding the surface sediment biogeochemical evolution following river flooding in coastal margins. This has required the development of a new modeling framework for capturing short-term dynamics in order to follow the sediment response to the perturbation. Using an event-driven early diagenesis model (FESDIA, Nmor et al., 2022) and observational data (Pastor et al., 2018), we demonstrate how the characteristics of the input materials dictate system recovery, resulting in different relaxation timescales for the major biogeochemical features. Once validated, the numerical simulation of these event-related dynamics allows us to estimate the impact of these abrupt processes on biogeochemical rates and flux through the sediment-water interface (SWI). The oxygen flux through the sediment-water interface decreased by 50% after a major spring flood in year 2008. Simultaneously, the occurrence of these flood-related depositions resulted in strong anoxic mineralisation dominated by sulfate reduction (72% of total organic carbon mineralisation), and methanogenesis (8%), which increased by more than twofold from pre-flood levels. This episodic event, with the oxidation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S by Mn and Fe (hydr)oxides, also initiates an efficient redox cycling of iron and manganese, which is responsible for the buildup of porewater Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;in the Rhône prodelta. Furthermore, examining the sequential manifestation of these flood-related depositions reveals that these events leave a temporary memory lag which becomes more pronounced as the sequence of terminal electron acceptor for organic carbon oxidation increases. This memory effect is related to the cumulative impact of deposition and is primarily related to the respective relaxation timescales of the oxidants. This study provides a current synthesis of extreme depositional events and their effects on biogeochemical processes in coastal marine environments.",5,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Palma,

These sediments contain a high inventory of organic carbon and variable amounts of carbonate, but fluxes between this interface and the overlying water column remain relatively understudied. Organic matter mineralization can occur via aerobic and/or anaerobic pathways with distinct implications for the resulting exchange with the overlying water column. Aerobic mineralization in sediments can be a small alkalinity sink, while anaerobic mineralization (e.g. denitrification, iron and sulfate reduction) serve as an alkalinity source. Calcium carbonate dissolution within sediments also has the potential to play a role in the sediment-water alkalinity exchange in this region. Alkalinity from sediments can provide a negative feedback to ocean acidification. Intact sediment core incubations were conducted, from the NW shelf, for direct measurements of organic matter mineralization rates through various pathways. All stations but one showed a net alkalinity source from sediments to the overlying waters. Three quarters of the stations contained high porewater ferrous iron suggesting active iron reduction, but free sulfide concentrations were low everywhere. Moderate rates of denitrification were measured across all stations above 500 m depth. Denitrification was dominated by coupled denitrification and thus may be only a limited source of alkalinity.

A pressing concern is how ecological communities respond to disturbances that occur at different intensities and time scales. We explored how the type of a disturbance, a pulse or press event, influences the dynamics of a marine community. A pulse disturbance is an event in which the ecological community’s biomass is affected by an abrupt change in the environment. Alternatively, press disturbances are long term, multi-generational pressures on communities over time. The Northeast US Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME) is one of the fastest warming regions in the world and has experienced historic overfishing. Assemblage shifts in the NES LME have previously been characterized, however these were prior to an unprecedented pulse disturbance marine heatwave event (MHW) in 2012 followed by punctuated MHWs over the last decade. I quantified community change across the NES LME using a community trajectory analysis (CTA), a multivariate tool which utilizes geometric analyses and comparisons of community trajectories, to quantify the shifts in dynamic beta diversity. I hypothesized the pulse MHWs would strongly influence ecosystem structure, however no significant impact was detected. The CTA supports previous findings of tropicalization in the NES LME associated with the presses of overfishing and increase in bottom temperature. The CTA has demonstrated success as a tool to quantify pressures in abruptly changing communities and we plan to expand this analysis to explore press and pulse disturbances in communities globally.",2,,6/7/23 8:30,6/7/23 10:00,Sala Palma,

To better understand the physical biological coupling that sustain these hotpots, we deployed a polar ocean observatory, purpose-built to resolve the necessary spatiotemporal scales of the Palmer Deep Canyon along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. This integrated ocean observing system resolved the ecological coupling from the underlying ocean dynamics up through the food web to the top predators. These data consistently highlighted the persistence of spatially varying features across the region. The spatial variability of these features is driven by small scale, but impactful differences in the overlying winds and freshwater inputs that can vary dramatically from one side of the hotspot to the other, which in turn affects the behavior of several predator species.

During the last few years, the mortality rate of coral reefs worldwide has surpassed the expected rate. As a result, an increasing biodiversity loss directly linked to these ecosystems is predicted if no action is taken to minimize ongoing die-offs. Most of the research on coral thermotolerance is focused on tolerance to the maximum heat stress expected but detailed data on the seasonal variability of thermal thresholds and how corals respond to changes in temperature are still lacking.

We observed significant seasonal changes in the photosynthetic efficiency and coral thermal tolerance (1ºC and 3ºC for <em>Acropora</em> sp. and <em>Pocillopora</em> sp. respectively) associated with the in situ temperature. The evidence of coral's capacity to respond to gradual changes in temperature in the short term may point to possible changes in the host gene expression and/or microbiome adaptations that can gradually confer some level of acclimation to seasonal temperature shifts.

Thermal history of corals is known to influence their potential to cope with heat waves, which is a concept applied in ex-situ stress-hardening or environmental priming approaches to enhance coral thermal tolerance. As systematic assessments of such protocols across coral species are currently lacking, we compared the effects of two stress-hardening regimes on the thermal tolerance of six stony coral species using (1) stable high temperature (29°C), (2) variable high temperature (29 ± 1.5°C), compared to (3) an ambient stable control temperature (26˚C). After preconditioning, we evaluated the immediate and long-term physiological response to acute thermal stress. In preconditioned corals, the baseline photosynthetic efficiency was higher and remained more stable under acute heat stress, and these corals also bleached less overall. Additionally, 30 days after heat, preconditioned corals survived or recovered at higher rates than the ambient temperature group. These findings shed light on the beneficial effects of stress-hardening on coral recovery, making preconditioning an effective method to support the acclimatization of corals.

Sea urchins were exposed to dial-oxygen fluctuations produced by macroalgae for 11 days at 5 targeted temperatures (20, 23, 26, 29, and 32 <sup>o</sup>C). We found that respiration rates at the optimal temperature (29 <sup>o</sup>C) doubled at the peak of oxygen concentration during the day (2.72 mg O<sub>2</sub> h<sup>-1</sup> urchin<sup>-1</sup>) than at the valley of oxygen concentration at night (1.41 mg O<sub>2</sub> h<sup>-1</sup> urchin<sup>-1</sup>). Oxygen concentration also affected the behavioral response of the sea urchin, where we found shorter righting response (time to turn from the aboral side to the oral side) on urchins during the peak of oxygen (average 218 s) than at the oxygen valley (average 280 s). This study reveals that marine vegetated habitats induce changes in oxygen concentration that might critically affect the metabolic performance and behaviour of marine organisms along a thermal gradient.",0,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Menorca A,

There have also been significant interannual fluctuations in these return rates, potentially linked to vulnerability to changing conditions during the first few months at sea. Here we investigate the interaction between ocean variability and variation in modelled early marine migrations of Atlantic salmon, taking historical variability as a set of natural experiments on the resilience of populations to future ocean change. We use a Lagrangian particle tracking model (FVCOM i-state Configuration Model) combined with an active swimming component to model the movement of salmon from UK/Irish rivers during their first three months at sea. Active movement is dependent on ocean currents and physical water properties (acting as a proxy for prey conditions). The model is driven by a high-resolution ocean model (Scottish Shelf Waters Reanalysis Service) providing 27 years of hindcast data. Small year-to-year changes in ocean currents and salinity cause the rate of successful migrations to vary from 17-82%. Ocean variability also influences the speed of migration and the time spent in coastal waters. We find coherence in the migration success rates between some geographically proximate rivers, with clear boundaries between these spatial groupings. These groupings seem to be related to clustering in marine return rates, suggesting that migration behaviour is one of the mechanisms linking marine survival to large-scale environmental drivers.",2,672,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Coralline algae are ecosystem engineers and hotspots of marine life occurring worldwide. Maërl beds provide a wide variety of ecosystem services such as nursery or carbon sequestration. Therefore, they are considered habitats with a remarkable conservation value, included in the European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). However, there are still human activities that threaten their ecological integrity such as bottom trawling, potentially increasing their vulnerability to climate change. The important components of the model and their relationships were defined based on literature review, expert knowledge and pre-processed quantitative data from Mediterranean maërl beds.

Although separate research efforts continue advancing the field and informing future experiments, the most appropriate way to compare data between projects is to process raw sequence files in one bioinformatic effort. Toward that end, the goal of this project was to analyze gut microbiome data from the blue mussel (<em>Mytilus edulis</em>) across several studies produced by members of one research group. In total, 167 samples of raw paired-end reads from seven separate datasets were loaded into the analysis pipeline and processed together to look for global trends. The selected data represented a broad diversity of samples collected during an array of years and seasons by three lead authors, and were generated from a breadth of experimental treatments and sampling methods. The primary trend in the results was a clear differentiation between microbial communities from mussels that had been allowed to void their gut during a no-food period prior to dissection and those from mussels that had not. This finding supports the developing paradigm about the difference between transient microbes ingested with food and then voided shortly afterward and resident microbes that reside permanently in the digestive tissues. Ultimately this effort highlights the importance of performing secondary multi-study analyses of raw microbiome sequence data, and of tailoring experimental designs and sampling schemes to match the specific experimental questions being addressed in future work.",3,,6/9/23 8:30,6/9/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,

Reef-building corals offer a highly biodiverse and data-rich system to test this idea, particularly as their conservation against anthropogenically-driven disease outbreaks is becoming highly prioritized. Here we tested whether coral microbiome traits are evolutionarily correlated with disease susceptibility across 425 million years of coral evolution. Through a combination of global coral microbiome data and long-term disease prevalence data, we show that microbial dominance and community composition strongly predict disease susceptibility. This was driven by a single putatively beneficial bacterial symbiont genus, &lt;em&gt;Endozoicomonas&lt;/em&gt;, whose relative abundances in coral tissue explained 30% of the variation in disease susceptibility. &lt;em&gt;Endozoicomonas&lt;/em&gt;<em> </em>abundances also significantly correlated with growth rate, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;Endozoicomonas&lt;/em&gt;-dominated lineages of corals may grow more quickly under ideal conditions, but are more likely to succumb to coral disease.

We performed microscopy and transcriptomic analyses of <em>A. rohweri</em> populations during a 6-week nutrient exposure experiment. We found that this parasite transitions from intracellular sites to mucocytes for release into the environment and that energy scavenging genes and those potentially involved in this habitat transition are significantly upregulated during enrichment. Specifically, transcripts involved in signaling, virulence, two-component systems, and nutrient import genes are elevated under higher nutrients. These data support the predicted role of <em>Ca.

To investigate the stability of the microbial community and its possible importance for seagrass establishment, we examined the effect of transplant site distance from the donor meadow (nearby, &lt;1 km versus more distant, 40 km) on the seagrass root and leaf microbiomes. Seagrass establishment was successful at both sites, but transplantation led to an initial disturbance of the leaf microbiome. After three months, prokaryotic communities on the leaves became more similar to those at the undisturbed donor meadow at the nearby site, but not at the distant site. The root microbiome however varied across plant, time, and space for both sites. This suggests that location specific effects outweigh host specific effects on leaves, but that the roots seem to be a more heterogeneous habitat.

We find that averaged across the global ocean, the wait-time between two plumes for a given cell is on the order of a few hours – similar to the expected encounter rate of motile and chemotactic cells with marine particles.

The organisms studied belong to three different trophic modes: &lt;em&gt;Oxyrris marina&lt;/em&gt; (an osmotroph), &lt;em&gt;Gyrodinium dominans&lt;/em&gt; (a phagotroph), and &lt;em&gt;Karlodinium armiger&lt;/em&gt; (a mixotroph). We analyzed the behavioral changes induced by the chemical stimuli by using a conventional capillary asset, broadly used in chemotaxis studies, along with an automated image analysis technique to track the individual trajectories of the swimming organisms. Our results indicate that all organisms exhibit a strong chemoattraction to DMSP, mild chemoattraction to DMS, and no chemorepulsion towards Acrylate, which contradicts previous studies. We also noted a chemokinetic response of &lt;em&gt;Gyrodinium d.&lt;/em&gt; to DMSP, as it altered the organism's swimming behavior in terms of speed and motility patterns. These findings could offer further understanding of how marine protists utilize these compounds and provide a deeper insight on the distinct foraging strategies employed by individual organisms depending on their trophic mode.",1,681,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, measuring the O<sub>2</sub> metabolism of individual microorganisms has been challenging due to technical limitations, which have limited our ability to investigate cell-to-cell heterogeneity within such populations. To address this issue, we developed SlipO<sub>2</sub>Chip, a glass-microfluidic device with integrated optode sensing chemistry that enables optical monitoring of O<sub>2</sub> metabolism in individual cells of various sizes (5-200 µm). The superb optical properties of SlipO<sub>2</sub>Chip allowed us to combine it with quantitative phase imaging (QPI), a non-invasive microscopy technique that measures the retardation of light passing through a cell sample to calculate its dry mass. The first correlative measurement highlighted the power of this approach to obtain combined data on the dry mass and metabolism of heterogeneous individual mammalian cells and phytoplankton cells. To conclude my talk, I will discuss how this highly-resolved data could be integrated into a widely-used scaling framework (‘Kleibers’ law’) and how this could improve our ability to predict the responses of communities of microorganisms to environmental change.",2,,6/7/23 10:30,6/7/23 12:00,Sala Portixol 2,

Our results indicate that fluid boundary layer thickness, drag coefficient, and general flow field did not noticeably differ from those of impermeable spheres with similar Reynolds numbers, suggesting that in situ formed aggregates generally behave according to Stokes’ law. However, the fractal nature of aggregates causes a decrease in excess density with increasing diameter and lower sinking velocities than predicted by Stokes’ law, underscoring the importance of accounting for porosity as a predictor of aggregate sinking velocity.

This is mainly because we lack methods that can accurately measure transport processes and O2 concentrations at the same time. Here, we present a novel method that combines microscale ratiometric and lifetime-based O2 imaging with particle velocimetry to determine O2 concentrations and flow fields simultaneously. This method, called “sensPIV”, allows to link O2 uptake to transport processes across a wide range of biological systems.

To investigate the presence of potential pathogens within the plastisphere we performed <em>in situ</em> incubations of plastics i) in a river downstream from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and ii) in a WWTP with posterior transition into the sea. The biofilms developed on plastics and control materials were analysed by metagenomics. Plastic materials –especially pre-weathered plastics– were enriched in AMR genes that confer resistance to various antibiotic classes, when compared to other materials and surrounding waters. In the river, typical genera associated with human pathogenicity (<em>e.g.</em>, <em>Escherichia</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, and <em>Streptococcus</em>) were relatively more abundant in the surrounding water samples than in biofilms, and metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to these taxonomic families were among those containing AMR genes and virulence-related genes. Similar results were observed in the WWTP incubations though, most interestingly, the transition to marine conditions showed a drastic variation of the microbial community colonising the plastics, mainly due to the rapid flocculation and loss of the biofilms due to the high ionic strength of seawater. Overall, while plastics develop a distinct microbial community containing high relative abundance of AMR, in the long run, the microbial community in the plastisphere is strongly conditioned by its surrounding environment. Also, there is a need to distinguish between ‘real’ clinically relevant pathogenic and non-pathogenic taxa, as well as their survival over environmental transitions, before drawing conclusions that plastics are vectors for pathogens.",1,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Menorca A,

Natural inoculum from treated wastewater release was also assessed. Different water quality indicators were monitored (nutrient concentrations, fecal bacteria abundance, and contaminants of emerging concern) to calculate and compare the removal efficiency in each bioreactor until the final evaluation in a pilot bioreactor in a small sewage facility. A set of biological parameters of benthic and planktonic communities were also measured simultaneously to be related to the bioreactor removal performance. The results demonstrated that benthic microbial communities (working alone or in combination with planktonic organisms) showed the highest nutrient removal efficiencies (65 to 99% removal efficiency in laboratory conditions over 25 to 70% in a real scenario).

For this purpose, a monitoring network was established with an upstream control sampling point, an effluent-discharge sampling point and two effluent-impacted sampling points located (500 m and 1,5 km) downstream the WWTP. At these locations, caged artificial glass-based substrates were placed in the river for a period of 4 weeks to allow for microbial biofilm formation. A 24 h effluent composite water sample and river water samples were collected in the same sampling points at three times: during substrate installation and 2 and 4 weeks later. Using next-generation sequencing techniques, the structure and function of prokaryotic biofilm communities was analysed in both biofilm and water samples, to be able to draw comparisons between biofilm communities and their planktonic counterparts.

In this microbe-driven function, benthic biofilms have a competitive advantage over planktonic communities since they accumulate P through not only intracellular but also extracellular pathways. We here investigated the concentration dependent pattern of P-entrapment. We performed an experiment in sediment biofilms in artificial flumes with a gradient of P additions (7 – 500 µg P/L). Results show that P saturation in biofilms is mechanism- and time-dependent. In the short-term (48 hours), intracellular P entrapment increased with a positive polynomial trend saturating at high P levels. In the long-term (2 weeks), intracellular P entrapment decreased with increasing dissolved P concentrations, while extracellular P entrapment increased until a high P level at which it saturated. P availability changed the dominance of biofilm P-entrapment pathways: at low P levels intracellular entrapment dominated, while at high P levels extracellular entrapment dominated. Linking results from biofilm P mechanisms to P mass balances in the water column (here: P inflow versus outflow of flumes) we see that in the short-term, water P removal correlated positively to both entrapment mechanisms (intra- and extracellular).

Structural patterns of the stained glycoconjugates were classified as associated to: cyanobacteria, bacterial clusters, filaments, and a cloud-like shape. Differences between sites were higher than differences between treatments. Specifically, higher glycoconjugates volume and cloud-like shaped EPS, and lower EPS associated to bacteria and filaments in La Muerte compared to Chiprana could be explained by environmental differences (e.g. Chiprana receives water from a permanent lake) that may result in distinct microbial communities inhabiting each lake and so different proportions in the EPS patterns.

Results showed no differences in heterotrophic functional diversity among sites but distinct functional fingerprinting among hydrological categories.

To understand the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) it is crucial to determine the factors that govern invasion of ARB into the river microbiome. Consequently, we here aim at elucidating how the resilience of resident microbiome against invasion by foreign ARB is determined by stress exposure. To achieve this, we grew natural microbial biofilms on glass slides in rivers for 1 month. Biofilms were then transferred to laboratory, recirculating flume systems and exposed to a single pulse of resistant invader bacteria (<em>E. coli</em>) either in presence or absence of stress induced by Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The invasion dynamics of <em>E. coli</em> into the biofilms were then monitored over time. Despite an initially successful introduction of <em>E. coli </em>into the biofilms, independent of the imposed stress, over time the invader perished in absence of stress. However, under stress the invading strain successfully established and proliferated in the biofilms. Noteworthy, the increased establishment success of the invader coincided with a loss in microbial community diversity under stress conditions, likely due to additional niche space becoming available for the invader. In conclusion, the intrinsic resilience of the river microbiome towards invasion by ARB is strongly linked with maintaining environmental diversity and that co-exposure to stressors that disrupt diversity increases long-term invasion success.",3,,6/8/23 10:30,6/8/23 12:00,Sala Menorca A,

However, little is known about how eddies impact intermediate trophic levels (e.g., zooplankton and micronekton) which play a key role in the carbon cycle and in the structure and functioning of Southern Ocean food webs. Here, we analyze acoustic observations from a 14-day survey of a cyclonic mesoscale eddy, its surrounding waters of the Sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ), and the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) waters where the eddy formed. Analyses of the distribution of acoustic backscatter at 18 and 75 kHz (indicating combined changes in species, size, and abundance of micronekton) reveal that the median water-column integrated acoustic backscatter values in the eddy core were only half of those measured in the SAZ waters surrounding the eddy, but similar to those measured in the PFZ, where the eddy originated 27 days prior. Furthermore, we find that the vertical distribution of acoustic backscatter matched the underwater light conditions characteristic of the eddy core, periphery, and surrounding waters, at scales smaller than 10 km. These results suggest that, as for physical and chemical tracers, the sampled eddy core maintained biological properties from its source waters creating a unique habitat compared to its surroundings.",4,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 1,

At its northern boundary, nutrient-rich SO waters interface with oligotrophic conditions from the Indian Ocean creating unique environmental conditions. These have a strong influence on protist communities, microscopic eukaryotic organisms and vital components of the ocean’s plankton. We investigated protist communities in the understudied environment of a Southern Indian Ocean mesoscale meander. Sequencing of the 18S rDNA gene region revealed a rich protist community with over 4000 assigned amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Diversity was highest in frontal waters of the mesoscale meander, with differences in community structure inside and outside the meander. While the community was dominated by mixotrophic taxa, mainly dinoflagellates, the frontal boundary of the meander had increased abundances of heterotrophic taxa, with potential implications for<sub> </sub>atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown. Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) community fluorimetry revealed significant differences in photophysiology between the centre and the boundary of the meander.&nbsp; Single cell PAM microscopy further showed differences in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) between dinoflagellate and coccolithophore taxa.

Between the two occupations, coccolithophores bloomed, and PIC concentrations increased 3.5x. In both occupations, PIC was highest in the Subantarctic Zone, where nitrate concentrations and temperatures could support more rapid coccolithophore growth. The highest measured PIC concentrations were found within a narrow temperature range, with a ~1ºC increase between occupations. A different, fresher water mass was also found when revisiting 150ºW; a sea-surface height-informed Lagrangian investigation into the potential origins of this water suggest it likely originated from the southeast of the transect. By pairing the cruise observations with a coccolithophore growth model for both occupations, we demonstrate that the modest increase in temperature between occupations can explain the observed rise in PIC.

Emissions of buoyant plastics <em>(Meijer et al., 2021)</em> from major rivers in Europe are used as an input to a Lagrangian particle model, with background currents from a 4 km resolution model of the North Atlantic <em>(Lein et al., 2013)</em>, to compute the discharge fluxes of plastics ending up in the NCC. We then use the computed particle fluxes from the NCC as input to a Lagrangian model fed with currents from a hydrodynamical model with 160 m resolution <em>(Dalsøren et al., 2020)</em> to track the pathways into and out of the fjords near Bergen in western Norway. We find estimates for the fraction of plastics moving into the fjords, and establish transboundary connectivity metrics for selected regions. We also assess the relative influence of windage, ocean currents and other oceanic processes known to be important for far field and intermediate scale transport. The results are of relevance to agencies working on laws for trans-national pollution and with ocean clean-up initiatives.",3,,6/6/23 10:30,6/6/23 12:00,Sala Palma,

However, analytical methods are still long and costly, and only a few techniques allow to detect NPs efficiently. Also, the processes of degradation and release of organic additives during plastic ageing into the environment still need to be better understood. Here, we present the main results of the JPI-Ocean funded Andromeda project (2020-2023), which focuses on (1) the completion of different types of analyses of MP and NP in the marine environment as well as (2) the degradation of different types of plastic materials (pristine, weathered and synthesized[DH1]&nbsp;).

However, the inter-comparison of these values is constrained by a lack of harmonization of the methods for sampling, extracting, and identifying these pollutants. Typically, nets are used for sampling floating MPs, limiting their quantification to the mesh size, predominantly 333 µm. Consequently, the presence of smaller MPs has mainly been overlooked, leading to underestimating their presence in aquatic environments. Distribution models and scarce in-situ observations suggest that MP concentrations and particle size decrease along the first meters of the water column. In this study, we investigate the MP vertical distribution using a novel filtration device to sample MPs (&gt;10 µm) in the air-surface interface and subsurface waters (5 m depth) simultaneously. During a JPI-Ocean FACTS cruise, sampling stations were selected following a gradient from high anthropogenic pressure areas to remote ones in the Byfjorden (Norway). MPs were extracted following a multi-step treatment, analyzed using state-of-the-art µFT-IR spectroscopy, and systematically identified using the software siMPle as well as pyr-GC/MS&nbsp; to quantify&nbsp;Tire Wear Particles (TWPs) content.

Static sampling at specific locations only provides discontinuous snapshots of the MPs contamination at the sea surface. Moreover, SMPs water sampling is demanding and time-consuming, affecting the tight schedule of research cruises. To overcome these limitations and gain insight into the horizontal spatial distribution of SMPs, we developed a novel COntinuos MicroPlastic Automatic Sampling System (COMPASS) operating while steaming with non-to-minimum supervision. A submersible pump, deployed into the ship’s moonpool, draws water from the vessel’s bottom to the wet lab. A second pump channels the flow into a pneumatic multi-valve system which automatically switches at selected time intervals, distributing water to 3 filtration devices, each capable of handling large volumes (&gt;1m<sup>3</sup>) down to 10 µm. The setup allows automatic uninterrupted sampling (&gt;3m<sup>3</sup>) over 9 hours. COMPASS was installed on board the RV Heincke during the JPI-OCEANS FACTS cruise and operated continuously for more than 800 NM from Bergen to Bear Island (Norway). The samples, processed and analyzed with state-of-the-art harmonized methods, will shed light on MPs spatial distribution in surface waters and their long-range transport from the North Sea to the Arctic.

GRID SAMPLING TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MICROPLASTIC AND TIRE WEAR PARTICLES IN SEABED SEDIMENTS,"When monitoring microplastic (MP) and tire wear particles (TWP) in marine sediments, the sample analysed is meant to be representative. However, is only a single grab enough to represent their concentration on the seabed? In this study, we assess the MP and TWP distribution variability on the seabed by sampling two grids of approx. 1 km<sup>2 </sup>located in Danish waters. We collected respectively 13 and 16 samples. The aim was to understand how many samples are needed to represent the mean concentration and the uncertainty compared to collecting a single grab. To extract MPs and TWPs from the sediments, samples underwent pre-oxidation, density separation, incubation by surfactants followed by multiple enzymatic digestions, Fenton oxidation, and further density separation. Extracts were analysed by FPA-µFTIR imaging for the identification of MPs and Pyr-GC/MS for TWP. The first technique provides MPs counts and allows for mass estimation. The latter technique quantifies TWP-mass but not particles’ number. The preliminary results showed that the first grid had the MP concentration ranging from 250 and 24848 µg/kg dw, while TWP varied between 58 and 35197 µg/kg dw. Initial results indicate that the variability of the second grid is of similar order. This study indicates that a single grab sample does not represent the concentration over a small area like 1 km<sup>2</sup>. However, multiple samples are needed to fully map the content of MP and TWP at the sampled location.

Cod was chosen as a fish representing both widespread food and an indicator for environmental contamination. The benthic feeder tusk is known to accumulate especially high levels of other contaminants and has a rather stationary behavior. Therefore, we analyze whether this species also accumulates microplastics. Fish were sampled in collaboration with commercial fishermen, scientific cruises, and private fishermen. At ten sites from south of Svalbard via Lofoten, west of Shetland, Bergen fjord system and down to Gøteborg, approximately 20 fish per station of either cod or tusk were caught wild. For three stations both species were caught.

State-of-the-art methodology was used for the detection and characterization of microplastics (type, size, color, polymer composition). Results showed that 95% samples were contaminated with MPs. Higher average concentrations of MPs were detected in river estuary samples compared to ocean. Higher density of particles was also found in the water column, compared to the surface water. Of the particles observed, 85% were fibers and 15% were fragments, predominantly blue and black. Through ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, the main polymers identified were polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinylchloride. In parallel, mussels (n=180) were sampled along the same gradient (river-sea) and a positive correlation was found between the levels of microplastics in waters and in mussels along the estuarine and open sea areas.

Field and laboratory studies allowed to define weighting factors and ecological thresholds for specific characteristics of MPs that can modulate the ingestion and toxicity of these particles to marine organisms, including the role of size, shape and other polymer characteristics, both alone and in combination with other environmental stressors. Logical flowcharts and mathematical algorithms were validated to summarize each typology of data into specific hazard quotients before their overall integration in a WOE risk index.

The different sampling campaigns carried out over the last two years focussed on different environmental matrices including the beaches, the surface water, the water column and the bottom sediments both inside and outside the estuary. Commercially valuable species were collected to assess the health status in relation to microplastics ingestion. A pristine estuarine marine sedimentary record was also analysed to assess the accumulation rate and mass of microplastics in the sediment over the last ±60 years. The results show that the freshwaters of the river represent a source of microplastics to the Mediterranean Sea while the estuarine sediment represents a sink for this pollution. The mass accumulation of microplastics in the coastal marine sediments increased exponentially over the last ±60 years following the global plastic production, while no significant pathological conditions were observed in the targeted biota.

We characterized MPs regarding their polymer type, size, shape, and for polyolefins weathering status. Additionally, we also investigated the potential of MPs smaller than the mesh size of the net (300 µm) to be incorporated in aggregates and compared the abundance and composition with the ones from the filtration device. Overall, preliminary results show that larger MPs (&gt;300 µm) are by a factor of 1000 less abundant and less diverse in terms of their polymer composition than small MPs (10-300 µm).

For example, while oceans will warm, the nutrients available for phytoplankton growth in many regions will drop. Second, projections of future environments carry high uncertainty. For example, projections of global average sea surface temperature changes in the coming decades span ~4°C, with uncertainties in local projections being even higher. Because of these two characteristics of ocean change, our understanding of organismal responses to it must be applicable over a wide range of multidriver environments.&nbsp; I will present experimental results of the plastic (short term) and evolutionary (long term) growth of a model diatom in 20-25 different temperature x nitrate environments, with each driver present as a gradient at each level of the other driver, also known as a fully factorial experiment. We show that the ability to respond to warming on all time scales is a function of initial nitrate availability, with the optimum temperature for growth (T<sub>opt</sub>) being a saturating function of nitrate availability in the short term. In the longer term, the ability to adapt to high temperatures by increasing growth and shifting T<sub>opt</sub> upwards depends on nitrate availability, and we identify the critical concentration of nitrate needed for adaptation to warming in otherwise ideal environments. Finally, we demonstrate that adaptation is linked to changes in common markers of stress, such as internal pools of reactive oxygen. We also discuss trends in changes in ecologically-important traits such as cell size across the full range of multidriver environments. The resourcing and logistics of fully-factorial multidriver experiments can appear substantial, but we strongly advocate for doing them where possible.

These copepods are dominant grazers in aquatic habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and support major fisheries. Intriguingly, we discovered that evolutionary changes during salinity transitions repeatedly involve the same loci (and SNPs) in wild populations and laboratory selection lines far beyond expectations. In both wild populations and laboratory lines, ion transporter genes dominate as the functional category undergoing natural selection. Using extensive simulations, we found that this degree of parallelism was consistent with positive synergistic epistasis among alleles, where selection on one allele promotes selection on other related alleles. Our results were consistent with mechanisms of ion uptake from dilute habitats, requiring the coordinated action of cooperating ion transporter proteins. Interestingly, temperature adaptation resulted in selection acting on an entirely different set of loci, indicating tradeoffs between salinity and temperature adaptation.

By contrast, ocean acidification alone (OA) did not impart strong selection or elicit an adaptive response. Adaptation to combined ocean warming and acidification (OWA), however, appeared to be limited. This limitation can be attributed to antagonistic interactions between warming and acidification. These interactions also manifested as a reduction of thermal tolerance (as defined by LD50) in the OWA-adapted lineage relative to the ambient treatment after 65 generations of selection. This finding suggests that adaptation to combined stressors may come at the expense of a population’s capacity to withstand high temperatures. It is unclear, however, how acidification alone may affect thermal limits. Here, we examined critical thermal maximum (CTmax) for the four lineages of <em>A. tonsa</em> adapted to ambient conditions of temperature and carbon dioxide (AA), OA, OW, and OWA for more than 100 generations. We observed a significant increase in the thermal maxima of both lineages adapted to increased temperature (OW and OWA lineages) relative to the AA lineage. Within temperature groups, however, there were no differences in thermal maxima. These results suggest that the lethal upper thermal limit of these four lineages is most strongly affected by adaptation to temperature, and that adaptation&nbsp;to acidification does not come with inherent costs in this trait.&nbsp; Reciprocal transplant experiments between the AA and OA lineages support this hypothesis.&nbsp;",0,696,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, these processes can interact in complex ways, both inhibiting and facilitating one another. For example, rapid adaptation can degrade plasticity while plastic responses may prevent adaptation. Plastic responses can include epigenetic mechanisms, such as environmentally sensitive changes in methylation, which can influence gene expression. These changes in methylation can in turn be under selection as they have phenotypic impacts. Here, we investigated the interaction between genome-wide methylation, allele frequency, and gene expression during 25 generations of experimental evolution of a marine copepod to warming, acidification, and their combination. Replicates within a treatment showed similar genome-wide changes in methylation patterns that differed between the treatments. The multiple stressor condition had the largest genetic and epigenetic shifts followed by warming; changes under acidification were minimal. The regions of the genome responding epigenetically were less likely to show genetic responses, suggesting that selection acted on different epigenetic and allelic loci. Finally, epigenetic shifts corresponded to gene expression differences, indicating a functional link between epigenetic and gene expression plasticity. Thus, both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contributed to the response to stressful global change conditions. However, changes in epigenetics, which were potentially plastic, targeted different regions from evolved allele frequency shifts, either inhibiting adaptation in these genomic regions or reflecting unique underpinnings of adaptive phenotypes.",1,695,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In the Baltic Sea, the effects of climate change will alter the temperature and salinity of the sea surface, which could lead to even more HAB events. In this study, twelve phytoplankton species were cultured at six salinity levels under the same temperature, light and nutrient conditions. Multiple traits of HAB-forming species were measured and compared to other phytoplankton species in the Baltic Sea to better understand the future fate of the phytoplankton community. In general, the average growth rate of the Baltic Sea species was highest at 5 psu, but a species-specific salinity optimum was observed. Furthermore, the growth rate of HAB species along the salinity gradient indicates a preference for 5 psu, while more non-HAB species grew in a higher salinity range typical for the Baltic Sea region (5 - 20 psu). Principal components cluster analysis clearly separates HAB species (faster nutrient uptake rate but slower growth rate) from non-HAB species (faster growth rate but slower nutrient uptake rate). The results suggest that the HAB species do not tolerate freshwater conditions, but prefer lower salinities. It remains to be investigated whether the continued decline in salinity below 5 psu in the Baltic Sea may favour a more frequent occurrence of HAB species. However, the presence and ability of HAB species to grow in low salinity conditions suggests that these species can thrive in the fresher Baltic Sea.",2,698,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Hybridization may contribute to speciation as a potential source of adaptive novelty by the introgression of selectively favored alleles in the recipient population. In our study, we use single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) arrays to study and monitor genetic diversity as well as population structure in the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi along the US Atlantic coast from Cape Cod to Chesapeake Bay. In particular, focusing on investigating patterns, directionality and evolution of hybridization. While all individuals north off Chesapeake Bay along the US east- coast were suggested to be non-admixed, the majority of individuals from Chesapeake Bay were of admixed origin. Hybridization was not restricted to F1 hybrids and first and second generation backcrosses were observed and hence introgression, which points to hybrids having an evolutionary advantage to thrive in the particular conditions of Chesapeake Bay. However, common garden experiments investigating the performance of hybrids under controlled conditions do not suggest a superior performance in terms of egg production, pointing to other mechanisms driving hybridization events in extreme events in nature.",3,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Sala Menorca A,

The susceptibility of a species to heatwaves likely depends on several variables, including the duration and intensity of thermal exposure. While heat survival time models (thermal tolerance landscapes) have a century-long history, their core assumptions still need to be tested under dynamic heatwave regimes. This study first examines whether the model based on log-linear regression of lethality buildup rates in response to constant temperatures can fairly predict the survival probability of a mussel population observed under heatwave regimes. Therefore, we conducted a protocol consisting of an indoor experiment of heat selection under constant temperatures, an outdoor experiment under dynamic heatwave regimes, and a Monte-Carlo simulation framed around the mathematically formulated assumptions. Second, we provide a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Approximate-Bayesian algorithm to separately predict posterior parameter distributions using the observed heatwave survival data for each experiment. We indicate that the new approach can inform regarding populations’ heat lethality buildup and sensitivity parameters and, therefore, it is applicable to test hypotheses about acclimation or adaptation effect on the parameters defining the population survival trajectory and to provide local prediction of future heatwave selection pressures on natural and aqua-cultured populations.",2,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Sala Menorca A,

These changes take place on a planet with seasonality, and many of the involved stressors and ecological interactions have some level of seasonality to them. Here I will focus on the interplay between the annual- and life-cycle scales. Much of our work is on behaviour and life history trade-offs in zooplankton species that are impacted by body-size dependent and seasonally varying predation risk caused by fish. Environmental changes are impacting these interactions and trade-offs in complex ways, including via changing duration and timing of the seasonal growth period. I present some of our findings and discuss the scope and constraints for adaptations (phenotypic plasticity as well as evolution) in traits such as body size, voltinism, energy storage, and seasonal timing. Responses are typically state-dependent and can depend on life history strategy, such as where on the gradient from income- to capital-breeding a species is placed. Reduced fecundity through capital breeding can then be one of the implications. New selection pressures have the power to restructure annual routines and life cycles. For instance, increasing size-specific predation risk selects for smaller body size and other characteristics of a faster life cycle, including shorter generation time. Our work illustrates how a range of life history trade-offs interact, are complicated by seasonality, and determine how organisms may adapt to environmental change.",1,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Sala Menorca A,Invited

Prey detect signals like kairomones released by predators involuntarily, which inform them of the predator's presence. Prey adaptive response to such signals is associated with changes in their behavior, life history or morphology. The cost of defense is high, so controlling its activation is critical. We hypothesize that some chemical cues, such as disturbance cues, alarm signals or high predator kairomone concentrations from populations where cannibalism is common, could inform prey about predator stress. Prey sensing predator stress should be favored by natural selection to avoid unnecessary defense costs - the anti-predator window. We analyzed the behavioral response cannibalistic predator of damselfly larvae <em>Ischnura elegans</em> to two kairomone concentrations and tested the physiological response of <em>Daphnia magna&nbsp;</em>(prey of <em>I. elegans</em>) to two <em>I. elegans</em>&nbsp;kairomone concentrations mixed with alarm signals or disturbance cues<em>.</em> <em>I. elegans</em> exposed to higher kairomone concentrations showed decreased hunting activity. <em>Daphnia</em> response to high kairomone concentrations and chemical signals indicative of predator stress was weaker, suggesting that <em>Daphnia</em> perceives a stressed predator as less dangerous.

Yet, adaptation may also involve phenotypic trade-offs in which some traits reach optimal levels over time while others decline. After experimentally evolving two foundational copepod species with contrasting seasonal dominance, <em>Acartia tonsa</em> and <em>Acartia</em> <em>hudsonica</em>, to ocean warming (OW), ocean acidification (OA), and combined ocean warming and acidification (OWA) conditions, we tested for phenotypic trade-offs and adaptation costs using reciprocal transplant experiments. Under OWA, <em>Acartia</em> <em>tonsa</em> sustained high egg production and hatching success at the expense of survival, while <em>Acartia</em> <em>hudsonica </em>experienced the reverse. These trade-offs led to similar decreases in overall population fitness in later generations, limiting evolutionary rescue under OWA. Moreover, <em>Acartia</em> <em>tonsa</em> struggled to maintain fitness in its original ambient environment after adapting to OWA, while <em>Acartia</em> <em>hudsonica</em> fitness was equally high in all environments post adaptation. Each species also exhibits differing responses to selection when warming and acidification interact in non-additive ways. These results suggest species specific adaptation mechanisms that determine which traits will respond positively to climate change and how tradeoffs limit adaptation. These results also suggest that adaptation to simultaneous warming and acidification leads to fitness trade-offs, while single-stressor adaptation does not.

Relatively low overlap in gene expression responses among conditions suggests that combined ocean warming and acidification results in a unique, synergistic physiological stress.

However, mercury deposition from more distant sources, together with physical and biogeochemical changes mediated by climate change, are altering the environmental cycling of mercury. To address the uncertainty of long-term aquatic exposure patterns in lakes across Canada, we have undertaken an extensive study of sediment archives. We first conducted a snapshot analysis of contemporary and pre-industrial paired samples (i.e., top-bottom approach) across 320 lakes, followed by a more detailed analysis of ~50 full sediment cores. With the top-bottom analysis, we identified an average two-fold enrichment in total mercury. The lowest contemporary concentrations of total mercury were found in lakes of the Prairie and Boreal Plains ecozones, which were often the most nutrient rich sites. Sediment organic matter and water chemistry variables were the strongest predictors of total mercury concentrations in contemporary sediments and explained ~60% of the variation across the country. With the full core analyses, we will develop generalized additive mixed models to characterize the temporal trajectories across 12 ecozones and consider climatic and geochemical indicators as possible explanatory variables.

This variability has made it difficult to attribute observed temporal patterns in lake chlorophyll (CHL) to broad-scale climate change. Quantifying the effects of climate on lakes is further complicated by the complex interactions with other strong drivers of CHL including land use intensification and lake, watershed, and regional characteristics. We addressed this challenge by studying annual CHL time series from 1984-2018 in 25,000 lakes in the continental U.S. along with climate and ecological drivers of lake CHL at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We used a combination of machine learning, generalized linear modeling, descriptive temporal statistics, and advanced time series analysis to quantify the role of climate and land use intensification on annual lake CHL. Over two-thirds of lakes exhibited abrupt changes that were either persistent or temporary in CHL (i.e., breakpoints or anomalies) and that were more likely to be lakes with low CHL. The lakes exhibiting these abrupt changes were those on the extreme ends of environmental gradients (e.g, elevation, soils, lake area). Lake CHL exhibiting abrupt temporal patterns was 3 times more likely to be linked to climate and land use intensification compared to lakes with linear trends and 10&nbsp;times more likely compared to lakes with no temporal pattern.

We performed a comprehensive analysis of the phytoplankton community composition of &gt;1,000 lakes across the conterminous USA, using data collected during the National Lakes Assessment of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our analysis reveals that geographical variation in phytoplankton community composition is best explained by total phosphorus (TP), water temperature and pH. High TP concentrations were associated with high relative abundances of cyanobacteria and euglenophytes. High temperatures stimulated cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, desmids and euglenophytes, whereas cryptophytes, golden algae and diatoms were relatively more abundant in colder lakes. Low pH correlated with high dissolved CO2 concentrations, which may explain why it benefitted phytoplankton with inefficient carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) such as golden algae and euglenophytes. Conversely, cyanobacteria increased strongly with lake pH, probably because their CCMs can effectively take up bicarbonate. Biodiversity increased with lake temperature, but decreased at high TP concentrations and high pH.

This data sparsity limits our ability to discern what those sites might look like in the future, e.g., which of these sites are tightly coupled to atmospheric processes and will therefore change with air temperature. Two recent advances in machine learning approaches allow us to leverage sparse, broad-scale observations to make accurate predictions of stream temperature. First, we used a recurrent graph network to inform the model of stream connections and share information across the stream network. Second, we pre-trained the machine learning model on a process-based stream temperature model to produce physically consistent predictions prior to exposing the model to observations.

The theory posits the existence of two alternative stable states each displaying resistance to changing environmental conditions with shifts between states being unpredictable. Here, use data covering a range of timescales to assess the generality of the theory in space and time. We show that a simple, deterministic link between shallow lake phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) and nutrient concentration becomes evident once a long-term (&gt;3 years) perspective is taken. Specifically, we find a linear relationship between multi-year means of nutrient concentration and chlorophyll-a, for two independent shallow lake datasets in Denmark and North America (902 lakes in total). In addition, palaeolimnological data generated for three shallow lakes show that loss of submerged plants was preceded by decades of progressive, predictable biological change, with no clear evidence for sudden changes as indicative of alternative stable states shifts. This demonstrates that with a longer-term perspective, the notion of alternative equilibria is unnecessary for explaining the response of chlorophyll-a to nutrient enrichment.

UVPs allow for the remote collection of large data sets on particle abundances and their size distributions and enable much higher spatial and temporal resolutions than traditional methods. The global use of UVPs enables us to study the ocean’s capacity to take up and store carbon via the biological pump and to develop a budget of particulate organic carbon flux. UVP flux estimates are typically derived from the size spectrum of particles but systematic comparisons with other carbon flux estimates are still lacking. Here we use a large data set of UVP measurements and independent carbon flux estimates (from sediment traps and thorium-234 measurements) to revisit the size distribution-based model for deriving UVP flux estimates.&nbsp; The data were collected in the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans as part of the EXPORTS study, encompassing a wide range of environmental conditions.&nbsp; We find that the optimally tuned model explains slightly less than 50% of the variance in estimated fluxes over the entire EXPORTS data set. Furthermore, agreement between particle stocks (UVP) and sinking particle export fluxes (traps/234Th) is expected only at steady state conditions. We conclude that knowing the UVP particle size distribution is insufficient for predicting sinking particle fluxes and propose an alternative approach to improve carbon flux estimates from UVP data.<sup>1</sup>Guidi et al.

These organisms transport carbon from the surface to the deep layers, thus enhancing the efficiency of the biological carbon pump and sustaining the metabolic requirements of mesopelagic communities. Zooplankton active flux has been addressed in different studies, supporting fluxes equivalent up to 10-30% of particle export. However, the role of micronekton in the active flux is scarcely known, and the capacity of both communities to export carbon is still poorly studied. Here, we show the results of both active (zooplankton and micronekton) and passive fluxes from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean around the Iberian Peninsula. Passive flux showed that particulate organic carbon (POC) was rather low even in the most productive zones of the Atlantic side. Regarding the active flux, we obtained a close relationship between migrant biomass and respiratory flux for both communities. Zooplankton total flux decreased in the northern Atlantic stations while micronekton flux increased, reaching more than two-times POC values. These results evidence the need to increase active flux estimations by both zooplankton and micronekton communities to better assess the role of the pelagic fauna in the biological carbon pump.",6,705,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

However, biogeochemical models used to simulate and predict mesopelagic carbon budgets still suffer from large uncertainties, which arise in part from poorly constrained parameters. Global ocean biogeochemistry models are typically optimized using climatological fields (e.g., nutrients, oxygen, export fluxes) as observational targets, therefore tuning them to reproduce the long-term mean state of the ocean. Our working hypothesis is that model parameters can be further constrained using high-resolution profiles from biogeochemical (BGC-) Argo floats, using particulate backscattering as a proxy for particulate organic carbon (POC). To test this hypothesis, we selected single-float coherent annual time series in the Labrador Sea (subpolar North Atlantic) and matched them to 1D biogeochemical model simulations (NEMO4-PISCESv2_RC). We then identified the model parameters that control mesopelagic POC budgets to (i) run comprehensive sensitivity analyses via parameter perturbations, (ii) optimize the most sensitive parameters against BGC-Argo observations using a genetic algorithm, and (iii) quantify the impact of parameter optimization on tridimensional POC fluxes.

However, due to insufficient observations, the vertical flux of organic carbon in the mesopelagic is poorly quantified and there are significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying flux attenuation. Recent advances within the Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) program have greatly increased the availability of biogeochemical observations including of mesopelagic particles that can be measured by backscatter, and of dissolved oxygen which holds information about respiration. This study uses BGC-Argo observations of dissolved oxygen and particulate organic carbon (POC) to improve our mechanistic understanding of the BCP. We first perform a novel mass budget analysis in the North Atlantic to assess the vertical carbon flux due to different mechanisms. Results show that on annual timescales, in addition to the gravitational settling of large POC, small POC contributes significantly to the vertical carbon flux at 100 m due to various mechanisms and at 600 m due to fragmentation of large POC. In-situ observations have shown that after escaping the euphotic zone, the vertical carbon flux attenuates preferentially at shallow depths, implying that either the remineralization rate is getting slower, or the sinking velocity is getting faster with depth. Alternative parameterizations based on these two mechanisms have been used in biogeochemical models and neither can be ruled out due to sparse in-situ observations. We compared the two parameterizations in an otherwise identical model environment. Both can well reproduce the BGC-Argo observations in the top 1000 m but predict different POC concentration below, making them distinguishable if BGC-Argo observations were available there.

Due to the complex biological interactions which occur in these aggregations, it is important to understand community assemblages with high spatial resolution that capture this patchiness. However, there are several challenges to studying zooplankton communities with such high fidelity. In situ imaging presents a major opportunity to better understand zooplankton community assemblages over fine-scale spatial and temporal dynamics. Yet, classic statistical approaches used to study zooplankton populations collected by nets do not directly apply to imagery data. Notably, in situ imaging devices sample much smaller, and inconsistent, volumes of water which can lead to inaccurate descriptions of zooplankton abundance. To better understand inferences from in situ imaging data, the volume sampled and its effect on organism detection needs to be taken into account. Occupancy modelling offers a clear method to describe zooplankton populations from in situ imaging data.

We measured biomass and the activity of the electron transfer system as a proxy for respiration in the water column down to 900 m depth. We found higher active flux during spring although migrant biomass during both seasons were strikingly similar. The higher active flux was due to a significant increase in respiration rates in the mesopelagic zone during spring from 200 to 500 m depth. We found sharp differences in active flux with higher values in the upwelling zone compared to the oceanic stations. Our results show that seasonality of active flux is not only driven by differences in biomass, but also to important differences in respiration rates in the mesopelagic zone between seasons.

Syndiniales were involved in 40-65% of network edges across all depths and were most often associated with Dinophyceae, Arthropoda (mainly Copepoda), and Rhizaria (e.g., Polycystinea and Acantharea), all considered potential hosts. The number of Syndiniales-Dinophyceae and Syndiniales-Arthropoda edges were highest in the epipelagic, while Syndiniales-Rhizaria edges peaked in the mesopelagic (500-800 m). Syndiniales sequences were often present only at a single depth or adjacent depths (e.g., 1-120 m), implying parasites may occupy depth-dependent ecological niches. Future analyses will consider the impact of abiotic factors on Syndiniales networks and aim to resolve potential parasite-host relationships at the species level. Insight into the spatial variability of Syndiniales networks will enhance predictions of mortality via parasitic infection and effects on carbon cycling.",5,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza A,

It also hosts a massive biomass of zooplankton and small fish that feed on sinking detritus (i.e., POC). However, scientific understanding of mesopelagic POC is still underdeveloped due to the numerous processes involved (gravitational sinking, horizontal transport, biological transformations by bacteria and zooplankton…).&nbsp; The objective of this study is to quantify the terms dominating the spatiotemporal variability of the mesopelagic POC budget in different regions of the North Atlantic. The choice of these regions is based on dynamical and biogeochemical criteria. Our analyses are based on numerical simulations performed with the ocean dynamical model NEMO4 (Madec et al. 2008) coupled to the biogeochemical model PISCES-v2 (Aumont et al. 2017).&nbsp; Compared to observations, our model shows biases in mesopelagic POC distribution and fluxes (from spatially distributed bioArgo floats and the sediment trap time series at BATS). Those biases can arise from uncertainties in POC supply from the surface layer and from the representation in mesopelagic processes in the model equations. Improving the model performance at the surface, we expect improving the model performance in the mesopelagic layer. For that, we develop a model sub-routine that allows constraining the model to follow satellite observations, in terms of small and large phytoplankton carbon biomass at the sea surface.

The impact of these processes on zooplankton communities has not been fully explored. This study investigates how the interaction between the seamounts and the Vitoria Eddy (VE) influences zooplankton abundance and particulate organic carbon (POC) vertical flux along the Vitoria-Trindade Seamount Chain (VTC), Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Vertical profiles using the UVP5 were performed along two transects (32 stations) near the VTC, during the summer of 2017. Rhizaria was dominant in all stations, contributing up to 65% to the zooplankton total abundance. Highest zooplankton abundances and POC fluxes occurred at stations simultaneously influenced by the shallow seamounts and the VE activity, as well as at stations only influenced by the VE. The combination of the seamount topography and the VE circulation increased local productivity and the accumulation and entrapment of particles, increasing zooplankton abundance and POC flux. Our results suggest that the energetic VE amplified the flow-topography effects of the shallow seamounts in the euphotic layer. The seamount-eddy interaction provides a substantial rise in the potential of carbon export to depth in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean oligotrophic waters, making the VTC and other seamount chains potential carbon export hotspots.",0,710,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The importance of these processes varies, depending on the behavioral and metabolic traits of organisms, so that a community dominated by large vertically migrating herbivorous copepods would increase the vertical flux, whereas a community dominated by small aggregate-feeding copepods would contribute to flux attenuation. We investigated the vertical distribution, fecal pellet production and aggregate feeding of large primarily herbivorous calanoids and small aggregate-colonizing copepods in the west coast of Greenland and Davis Strait in summer. We sampled zooplankton at 35 stations, using a Multinet with a 50 µm mesh, and conducted incubations to measure pellet production and aggregate feeding rates. Although the small copepods always dominated zooplankton abundance, the ratio of small vs. large copepods varied by 8-fold between the stations as did the pellet production and feeding rates. Our preliminary results indicate large differences both in proportional abundances of species and pellet production rates between the stations, suggesting that changing environment influences the effect of zooplankton on the biological pump, both through its effect on community composition and through its effect on the metabolic rates of copepods.",7,709,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

DOC was extremely deficient in the FGW (35 ± 13 μM) and positively correlated with salinity in the coastal environment, indicating oceanic DOC contribution. The FDOM<sub>P</sub> pattern was similar to that of DOC, suggesting that marine biological production is a primary DOC source in this region. Particularly, significant FDOM<sub>P</sub> correlations in the coastal waters with the fluxes of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and dissolved silicon from the FGW demonstrated that in situ biological production is facilitated by FGW-borne nutrient addition. However, the absence of a correlation between the fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and FDOM<sub>P</sub> indicated that anthropogenic DIN is not essential for DOC production under the P-limited nutrient conditions and diatom-dominant conditions prevailing on the coastal Jeju Island. Here, we calculated the potential capacity of carbon fixation by marine biological activity based on the Redfield ratio of carbon and phosphorus with DIP fluxes.

In contrast, HS in the surface has a broad MW distribution (1–6&nbsp;kDa), which shrinks at depth to a narrow MW range of ~1.3 kDa, which is just above the nominal MW cut-off of the filter (1 kDa). Despite the decrease in MW distribution, the concentration of HS retained by the UF filter does not decrease with depth, suggesting either that large HS (3–6 kDa) in the surface are degraded into smaller compounds (1–2 kDa) without significant remineralization, or that there is a source of &lt;2.5 kDa HS to the deep ocean.

During an oceanographic cruise in the summer of 2017, we sampled a hydrographic box encompassing the CVFZ. Full-depth profiles of absorption spectra of coloured (CDOM) and excitation-emission matrices of fluorescent (FDOM) dissolved organic matter were collected and examined to produce an assortment of CDOM indices and 5-FDOM PARAFAC components. In epipelagic waters, we identified distinctive optical signatures in open ocean waters north and south of the CVF and in coastal waters transported by the CBGF that provide new insights on the origin (terrestrial vs. marine), photochemical and microbial reactivity (lability vs. recalcitrance), and molecular properties (molecular weight, aromaticity) of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In mesopelagic waters, we optically characterised the water masses of opposing origin that meet in the CVFZ: North and South Atlantic Central Water, Subpolar Mode Water, Mediterranean Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water and Labrador Seawater.

The perturbation of the Canary Current by the topography of the Canary Islands induces the generation of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies at the lee of the islands, which propagate to the subtropical open ocean through the Canary Eddy Corridor (CEC). In August and November 2022, we carried out two oceanographic cruises south of the Canary Archipelago, with the aim of studying these eddies during their life history. During the first cruise we examined three eddies in an early stage of development: Nublo (cyclonic, south of Gran Canaria), Anaga (anticyclonic, south of Tenerife), and Garajonay (cyclonic, between El Hierro and La Palma). In the course of the second cruise we sampled a large mature anticyclonic eddy (Bentayga) located 250 miles southwest of Gran Canaria, which multiplied its extension more than ten times since its generation, five months before.

The distribution of <em>δ</em><sup>13</sup>C<sub>DOC</sub> and higher abundance of humic-like fluorescent component and highly unsaturated and phenolics (HUPs) compound reflected a prominent contribution of allochthonous DOM.

With increasing agricultural and urban land downstream, there were more heteroatomic formulae and labile aliphatic and protein-like compounds derived from human activities and in situ primary production. Besides, chemical sulfurization, hydrogenation and oxidation were found during molecular cycling processes in different reaches. Weaker solar radiation and water dilution during the dry/cold season left highly aromatic, oxygenated and unsaturated DOM composition.

We conducted long-term biodegradation experiments and field surveys on a large, deep lake (Lake Biwa, Japan) to elucidate the dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the hypolimnion. The biodegradation experiments (&gt;250 days) were conducted with hypolimnetic water collected in March 2020 (the mixing period). The water samples were incubated in the dark at 9°C (the water temperature of the hypolimnion) or 20°C. The hypolimnetic waters at the same site were collected monthly from March to December 2020 (through the stratified period). The molecular size distribution of DOM was quantified using a size-exclusion chromatograph coupled with a total organic carbon detector (SEC-TOC). The net degradation rates of high molecular weight DOM (HMWDOM: M<sub>w</sub> ~ 100kDa) were estimated for each concentration time series. The rates were faster in the order of the 20°C experiment &gt; the 9°C experiment &gt; and the monthly time series of hypolimnetic waters. This result indicates that the HMWDOM production fueled by sinking particles would be considered to explain the apparent persistence of HMWDOM in the hypolimnion. We also estimated the gross degradation flux (= the net degradation flux + the production flux) of HMWDOM in the hypolimnion, which was 4&nbsp;times higher than the net degradation flux. The cryptic cycling of HMWDOM was linked to O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the hypolimnion, suggesting that it should be a critical biogeochemical process in deep lakes.",4,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Palma,

Microbial activity, however, have been largely measured under atmospheric pressure conditions. In this study, we determined prokaryotic heterotrophic activity under in situ conditions using an In Situ Microbial Incubator (ISMI) and compared the <em>in situ</em> activity with that under atmospheric pressure conditions. The ISMI was deployed from epi- to bathypelagic depths in the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern Ocean. The bulk activity under <em>in situ</em> conditions was increasingly inhibited with increasing hydrostatic pressure. At 4000 m depth, the bulk heterotrophic prokaryotic activity under <em>in situ</em> hydrostatic pressure was about one-third of that measured in the same community under atmospheric conditions. Single-cell analysis showed that about 85% of bathypelagic prokaryotes were piezotolerant, while piezosensitives and piezophiles comprised rather small fractions. Metaproteomics revealed their taxonomically characteristic survival strategies at meso- and bathypelagic depths. Piezosensitive bacteria likely originating from the upper water column increased their activity more than 100-fold upon depressurization. Thus, the higher bulk activity of the deep-sea prokaryotic community measured upon depressurization is due to a small yet highly active fraction of the deep-sea prokaryotic community. Taken together, the heterotrophic prokaryotic activity in the deep-sea is substantially lower than hitherto assumed with major impacts on the carbon budget of the ocean’s interior.",0,,6/5/23 10:30,6/5/23 12:00,Sala Palma,Invited

Using a combination of stable isotopes (C, S, O) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS), we reveal the connections between vegetation, sulfurization of carbonate-associated organic matter, and its release to the water column. We find that seagrass mediated oxygen pumping in the rhizosphere fuels sulfide oxidation, which determines the low net rates of sulfate reduction observed despite high gross rates. This sulfide oxidation in turn contributes to localized carbonate dissolution, while carbonate precipitation elsewhere leads to low net rates of precipitation. FT-ICR-MS analysis reveals intense sulfurization of carbonate-associated “dissolvable” organic matter likely through a combination of reactions with sulfide, polysulfides, and other sulfur intermediates, while the rapid cycling of carbonate dissolution and precipitation allows for the connectivity of this pool with the porewater and water column. Despite low net rates of sulfate reduction and carbonate dissolution, this system is a factory for the sulfurization of already highly photodegraded and likely recalcitrant, dissolved organic sulfur.",3,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Palma,

These factors are likely to change with ongoing climate change and human activities with significant implications for local ecosystem function and the global carbon cycle. Thus, quantifying the relationship between these controls and organic matter decay rates is critical. Studies showing significant linear relationships between water residence time and bulk molecular characteristics, and DOM decay rates and water residence times suggest that DOM molecular composition is an important control of DOM decay rates in freshwater systems. However, more than half of the variability in decay rates still remains unexplained. We aimed to improve the predictability of DOM decay rates by directly linking incubation measurements of dark bacterioplankton respiration with DOM molecular composition and other site idiosyncratic factors (e.g. nutrients), in addition to water residence time, across 60 stream/river and 92 lake sites that are routinely monitored in Sweden. Bacterial respiration rates were quantified from the rate of oxygen loss in dark incubations. DOM molecular characteristics were quantified using simple absorbance and fluorescence metrics along with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) with additional samples collected for future FTICR-MS analysis.

However, the number of known metabolites and activities represents only a small fraction of all compounds we can detect in these environments. To fully map out the structural and bioactivity space, new methods are needed, as traditional isolation and bioactivity studies do not scale to contemporary non-targeted metabolomics workflows. To address this need, we develop functional metabolomics tools that integrate multi-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with bioactivity profiling as well as native mass spectrometry. In combination with molecular networking, these workflows allow us to screen complex environmental samples for bioactivity, metal and protein binding and metabolic transformations.

One way to minimize confounding factors is to utilize simplified environmental settings where such factors are limited. In ice-free areas on Sôya Coast of East Antarctica, DOM is primarily derived from in-situ biological activity in water with only limited terrestrial inputs and direct human influences. Here we show, by combining ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, that DOM molecular composition varies considerably among 43 lakes on Sôya Coast. The DOM composition in these lakes is primarily driven by differences in the degree of photodegradation, sulfurization, and pH. Remarkable molecular beta-diversity of DOM was found that rivals the dissimilarity between DOM of rivers and the deep ocean, which was driven by environmental dissimilarity rather than spatial distance. Our results emphasize that the extensive molecular diversity of DOM can arise even in one of the most pristine and organic matter source-limited environments on Earth, but at the same time, DOM composition is predictable by environmental variables and the lakes’ ecological history.",6,726,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

We hypothesize that explicitly accounting for the use of light as energy source for heterotrophic bacteria challenges our understanding of the marine carbon cycle.

The model is implemented as a submodule in the full-scale ecosystem model ERSEM. Physical ocean models GOTM and NEMO simulate&nbsp;results for different regions and light regimes across the North Atlantic. In surface waters, results show relatively higher bacteria concentrations leading to an enhanced microbial carbon pump, producing more refractory organic carbon, and an enhanced bacteria-zooplankton carbon flux than previously predicted (and vice versa in deep layers).

The Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC) is of particular interest to this respect, as subantarctic and subtropical waters of very different characteristics meet in the BMC. Further, the BMC is an important site for the returning Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), largely setting the latitudinal rate of transfer of key properties.

Average initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient concentrations varied widely, with urban stormwater ponds having significantly lower concentrations than forested uplands. Low complexity DOM, defined by the absorption coefficient at 254&nbsp;nm, was more characteristic of ponds relative to uplands. DOM lability (180-d DOC loss) was lowest in uplands (19%) and highest in ponds (30±2%), with decay rates averaging -0.03 to -0.06±0.01 uM DOC d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Along with optical indices indicating terrestrial vs. microbial-derived fulvic acids, degrees of DOM humification, and autochthonous DOM, correlations between source, lability, and DOM components were determined from parallel factor analysis. Combined, these results and indices reveal that urban areas export DOM that is structurally less complex and more readily remineralized than forested sites, likely contributing to DO impacts in urban areas.

Heterotrophic bacteria are the important conduit for shaping the marine DOM pool via assimilation, transformation and release of organic molecules. Meanwhile the changes in bioavailable organic substrates can also affect the composition of bacterial community. Both microbial communities and organic substrates could influence the microbial produced DOM, and the experiments reveal that the microbial complexity was more important than the substrate in shaping the molecular composition of DOM. Further, the DOM composition played a larger role in shaping the microbial compositions than the concentrations of DOM and inorganic nutrients. The co-occurrence network analysis revealed that complex substrates resulted in higher molecular diversity of the microbial produced DOM, sustained a higher microbial diversity, and maintained a more diverse association between microbial communities and DOM molecules. In addition, the chemical composition of microbial produced DOM demonstrated that CHO, CHON and CHOS containing molecules were enriched in the glucose, GBT and DMSP experiments, respectively. The spatiotemporal signatures of microbial communities and DOM composition suggested microorganisms likely transformed the DOM from a relatively high (<em>&gt;</em>400 Da) to a low (<em>&lt;</em>400 Da) molecular weight, corresponding to an apparent increase in overall aromaticity. K- and r-strategists exhibited different correlations with two-size categories of DOM molecules owing to their different lifestyles and responses to environmental nutrient conditions.

In the Arctic Ocean, SSA are also produced via bubble-bursting within leads between ice floes. Arctic SSA production is predicted to be increasing with increasing sea ice loss as global temperatures continue to rise. Chemical characterization of SSA in the Arctic is necessary for constraining the impacts of this growing source of aerosol particles. To connect seawater composition and microbiology with SSA, seawater was collected from various locations in the marginal ice zone and pack ice in the High Arctic during the Aug. – Sep. 2018 Microbiology-Ocean-Cloud-Coupling in the High Arctic (MOCCHA) campaign. The water collected from each location was used to generate SSA particles in a marine aerosol reference tank aboard the icebreaker. The surface water salinity, chlorophyll-a concentration, organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations, and microbial community composition were measured.&nbsp; The SSA particles were collected, and thousands of individual atmospheric particles from each location were subsequently analyzed using scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis and Raman microspectroscopy in order to gain insights into chemical properties of SSA particles in the rapidly changing Arctic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chemical composition of nascent SSA is influenced by the elemental ratios of seawater ions and the biological state of the marine microbial community. The production of organic material in the local seawater increases during a phytoplankton bloom, though the effects of this material on SSA composition and subsequent cloud droplet formation are unclear. While the abundance of eukaryotic plankton was elevated in water sampled from the marginal ice zone and in ice floe water amended with ice algae, the relative contribution from major eukaryotic taxonomic groups varied little across the water samples. Nascent SSA particles mainly consisted of sea salt, which was composed primarily of sodium chloride, with smaller contributions from other inorganic salts. The SSA particles were often coated in organic materials, including saccharides and fatty acids. Organic-only particles were also produced during the marine aerosol generation. The distribution of organic and inorganic components within aerosol particles affects their ability to activate as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nucleating particles, which in turn impacts weather and climate.",12,730,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Here, we explore the competitive interactions of multiple micro-predators with a single prey bacterium,<em> V. parahaemolyticus (Vp)</em>, in a brackish laboratory microcosm. The responses of these micro-predators to an input of the prey, were monitored at 3h intervals in a 120h time-series study. Size differences enabled the separation of the viruses, protist and HBx in the environmental sample by differential filtration, and the establishment of microcosms with select combinations of the predators, [viruses/<em>HBx</em>/small protists], [viruses/HBx /all protists], [viruses/HBx], and viruses only, all with Vp prey. &nbsp;Quantitation by qPCR of samples from each microcosm at 3h intervals showed a rapid reduction in the <em>Vp</em> population in all except the [virus/Vp] microcosm. The reduction of prey in the [viruses/HBx/all protists] microcosm was significantly greater than the [viruses/HBx/small protists] (p=0.0005). Reduction in prey in the [virus/HBx] microcosm was significantly greater than in the [virus/Vp] due to predation by the HBx. No significant difference in prey reduction was observed between the [viruses/HBx] and [viruses/HBx/small protists] microcosms. There was a significant difference in prey reduction between [viruses/HBx] and all predators (p=0.0166). In conclusion that the predatory HBx are competitive with protists and viruses in the lyses of bacteria and play a key role in nutrient cycling. &nbsp;",13,721,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Other micro-predators such as the predatory bacteria have not been widely acknowledged. The primary event that leads to the cycling of nutrients through the microbial loop is the lysis of bacteria by micro-predators. Predatory bacteria have been reported to be as adept as the protists and viruses, or competitive with them, in predation that results in bacterial lysis.&nbsp; To fully understand biogeochemical cycling requires that organisms capable of producing bacterial lysis on a large scale be included in the analysis. There are dozens of bacteria with predatory capabilities and, undoubtedly, many more yet to be discovered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The predatory bacteria are a highly diverse group of different genera and species that exhibit widely different modes of predation. Some are generalists preying on a broad range of bacterial species. Others are specialists that prey only on specific species. &nbsp;Most are not obligate predators, but rather facultative. Among the most studied predatory bacteria are the myxobacteria and the obligate predators, Bdellovibrio and like organisms. The halophilic genus, <em>Halobacteriovorax</em>, has been observed to consistently compete with the other micro-predators in lysing Vibrio and other species. This micro-predator lyses Gram-negative, but typically not Gram-positive bacteria.

Here, single-cell measurements reveal that <em>Prochlorococcus</em> at the base of the photic zone in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea are obtaining only ~20% of carbon required for growth by photosynthesis. Consistently, laboratory-calibrated evaluations of <em>Prochlorococcus</em> photosynthesis indicate that carbon fixation is systematically too low to support published <em>in situ</em> growth rates in the deep photic layer of the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, agent-based model simulations show that mixotrophic cells maintain realistic growth rates and populations 10s of meters deeper than obligate photo-autotrophs, deepening the nutricline and Deep Chlorophyll Maximum by ~20 m. Time-series of <em>Prochlorococcus</em> ecotype-abundance from the subtropical North Atlantic and North Pacific suggest that up to 30% of the <em>Prochlorococcus</em> cells live where light intensity is not enough to sustain obligate photo-autotrophic populations during warm, stratified periods.

In nearshore systems like coral reefs metabolites exuded by primary producers comprise a significant fraction of this marine DOM pool. To learn more about the chemical composition we performed untargeted molecular analysis of exudates released by coral reef primary producers (corals and algae) using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Of 10,568 distinct ion features recovered from reef waters, 1,667 were primary producer exudates; the majority (86%) of these exudates were organism specific, reflecting a clear divide between coral and algal exometabolomes. The stoichiometric analyses of the exudates revealed a significantly reduced nominal carbon oxidation state of algal- compared to coral exometabolites, illustrating an ecological mechanism by which algal phase shifts engender fundamental changes in the biogeochemistry of reef biomes. Coral exometabolomes were enriched in diverse sources of nitrogen and phosphorus, including tyrosine derivatives, oleoyltaurines, and acyl carnitines. In contrast DOM released by algae was dominated by nonnitrogenous compounds, including diverse prenol lipids and steroids. Additional experiments indicate that exudates, specifically exudates unique to the respective treatment, were the main substrate used by heterotrophic microbes exposed to the respective exometabolome.

In 2017, joint working groups involving researchers and environmental authorities agreed on an inter-institutional roadmap for marine litter monitoring in Colombia. Five thematic axes were considered, namely research, monitoring, technical capacity building, communication and technical-regulatory articulation. Today, a country wide environmental database on marine litter pollution encompasses 40 beaches and 33 mangroves, together with case studies on impacts and risks from microplastics over lagoons, fishing resources and human well-being in vulnerable areas. The database shows how differences in geography, socioeconomics, climate and coastal dynamics amongst the two Colombian coasts determine ecosystem impacts. It shows, for instance, that the areas closer to large population centers are the most litter polluted.

The ingestion of microplastics by estuarine fishes varies greatly depending on the feeding strategies of different fish species.&nbsp; We analyzed trophic pathways leading to microplastic ingestion by comparing microplastic loads in intestinal tracts from estuarine fishes in South Carolina (USA). &nbsp;Fibers were the most common type of plastic in all species, but plastic fragments, foam and tire wear particles were also abundant. Benthic feeding fishes with distributions restricted to vegetated marsh habitats where microplastics are trapped had higher concentrations of microplastics than those inhabiting nearby sandy environments with higher water flow. Planktivorous fishes had the highest loads of microplastics of all fishes, including predatory and detritivore species. Planktivorous juvenile Atlantic Menhaden selectively feed on marine snow particulate aggregates showed the highest concentrations of ingested microplastics. Larger predatory shark species specie that mainly feed on Atlantic Menhaden showed higher microplastic concentrations than those targeting other prey species, indicating the potential key role that marine snow particles and Menhaden play in the trophic distribution of microplastics through estuarine food webs in the western Atlantic.

Yet, our knowledge about the degradation, burial and transportation of beached marine plastic debris (MPD) remains limited and little is known about the exact capacity of beaches to store and retain MPD. The beaches of Hawaii accumulate high amounts of MPD given their location and proximity to the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, in which the floating plastic accumulation is known as the Garbage Patch.

A random subset of sampled MPD is analysed further under Infrared Spectroscopy for polymer identification. For the different 10 cm layers we observe a range of concentrations at the different depths with the number of MPD particles ranging from 0 to over 1000 particles per 10 cm layer (36 litre of sand) and observe significant differences in MPD distribution in the sand column between the three selected beaches.

Coastal vegetated habitats (e.g., seagrasses, saltmarshes, mangroves) provide a myriad of ecosystem functions, such as erosion protection, habitat refuge and nursery grounds, and carbon storage. The biological and physical factors that underlie these functions may provide an additional benefit: trapping of marine microplastics. While microplastics occurrence in coastal vegetated sediments is well documented, there is conflicting evidence on whether the presence of vegetation enhances microplastics trapping relative to bare sites. Moreover, the factors that influence the likelihood of microplastic trapping remain understudied. We aimed to investigate how vegetation structure and microplastic type influences trapping in a simulated coastal wetland. Through a flume experiment, we measured the efficiency of microplastic trapping in the presence of two types of vegetation – branched and grassy, and tested an array of microplastics that differ in shape, size, and polymer. We show that the presence of vegetation did not affect the number of microplastics trapped but did affect location of deposition. Microplastic shape, rather than polymer, was the dominant factor in determining whether microplastics were retained in the sediment or adhered to the vegetation canopy. The outcome of this study enriches our understanding of coastal vegetation as a microplastics sink and that differences among microplastics informs where they are most likely to accumulate within a biogenic canopy.",2,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza A,

In addition, we assessed MPs ingestion in the Eastern and Western lineages of the brown mussel <em>Perna perna</em> sampled at sites where the two lineages overlap in their distribution along the South African shores.

Biofilm affects the object’s buoyancy and its density, hence impacting the distribution and sinking behaviors of plastics in the marine environment. Here, we assess the effect of biofouling on the rise velocity of positively buoyant polyolefins in the water column in environmentally relevant marine conditions. To establish whether biofouling influences the transport of plastics and enhances their removal from surface waters, we conducted a long-term monitoring experiment within a flow-through aquaculture system on Oʻahu, Hawaii using low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene of different sizes and shapes (films, rods, and cubes). Physico-chemical variables of the polymers were measured on a weekly and monthly basis, while environmental parameters such as light exposure, temperature, and chl a were monitored at higher resolution (days to minutes). Preliminary results show that HDPE and small size film has the potential to sink faster and that the surface area to volume ratio is the parameter influencing most the rise velocity when considering the different shapes and sizes. This study offers one of the first empirical data to incorporate into numerical models to assess the effect of biofouling on plastic rise velocities and helps predict the fate and sinks of positively buoyant plastics in the ocean. &nbsp;",1,739,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Also, previous experimental studies on MP incorporation in corals have mostly focused on single MP types. To investigate the factors that influence MP incorporation in reef-building corals, we exposed the two species <em>Stylophora pistillata</em> and <em>Pocillopora verrucosa</em> to different pollution scenarios in two independent experiments: 1) distinct mixtures of MP, chosen to represent major anthropogenic pollutants (i.e., fragmented marine plastic waste, residues from the automobile sector, and artificial fibers), and 2) a standardized mixture of MP, chosen to represent the MP types mainly found in nature (PE, PVC, PS, PA, PP, and PET), applied at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mg/l). To quantify the incorporation of the MP, we separately dissolved coral tissue and skeleton, extracted MP, and standardized the numbers of MP found to the coral’s surface area and accreted skeleton. Our results show similar incorporation rates across different MP mixtures, suggesting the absence of selective processes for the incorporation of MP into the tissue and afterwards skeleton of reef-building corals.

This study presents the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and hydro-meteorological measuring sensors in the catchment to (1) identify, monitor, and quantify macroplastic waste hotspots along the Umgeni River; and (2) investigate the influence of hydro-meteorological factors driving the spatio-temporal evolution of the hotspots. Preliminary findings from two of the eleven monitored hotspots indicate a gradual build-up of surface area impacted by plastic pollution by 40–50% from January–April 2022. In April 2022, alone, a sharp decrease of –40–60% was recorded following a major flood event in Durban, when most parts of the city received rainfall between 200–400 mm within 24-hours (average April rainfall: 33.1 mm). Post flooding the surface area impacted by plastic pollution begins to gradually build-up again by 40–60% between April–June 2022. The findings suggest that macroplastics riverine transport and ocean emissions are considerably influenced by the flushing of waste stocks in discrete hydro-meteo events. Such information will help refine temporal resolution of riverine pollution contributions to the receiving coastal environments.

One-third of all deployed drifters moved through the river network and out to sea.&nbsp;Of the drifters deployed in the main rivers alone (n = 53), 40%–90% transferred to sea, depending on the season.&nbsp;The&nbsp;mean main river transition time before emission to the sea was only six days. Four out of 15 drifters deployed in tributary ravines were flushed to sea – they took 20 to 50 days to reach the Caribbean. Mobility and river-ocean transition probability is associated with rainfall intensity during drifter lifetime. Ocean emission probability was roughly halved&nbsp;within 10 km deployment distance from the river mouth during the experimental period&nbsp;(R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5; p &lt; 0.005).&nbsp;Seaborne drifters moved westwards in the Caribbean current, stranding along the coast of Hispaniola Island. Although the investigated river length is relatively short, the results are surprising, considering the presence of structural impediments and riverbank vegetation.

The Ozama River located in the &gt;3 million-inhabitant city of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, is considered one of the largest contributors of terrestrial macroplastic waste to the Caribbean Sea. Modeled emission estimates show high uncertainty due to the lack of consistent, long-term field data. Mounted monitoring cameras (n = 8) across two main river bridges at 5.5 km and 2.2 km upstream of the river mouth validated current flux and emission models of macro debris (&gt;5 cm). Analysis of 380,000 images collected over 383 days starting February 2022 shows a 2-fold increase and a 1.5-fold increase in debris concentrations and mass fluxes, respectively, in the downstream direction. The increased debris detection downstream is associated with the influx from riparian ravines (cañadas) and illegal waste dumping along the stream. A daily average of 0.9 tons of anthropogenic ""trash"" flux was detected at the downstream location, resulting in over 300 tons and 10 million macro particles annually. This mass flux is at the low range of previous model estimates. The mass flux of organic materials, such as water hyacinths, was up to ten times higher than the trash fluxes. The data shows a positive correlation between organic and non-organic waste peaks, reflecting the findings of previous studies.

A three-year observational study was completed to determine the extent of microplastic occurrence in Lake George, a large oligotrophic lake in upstate New York, USA. Microplastics were quantified in samples collected from the Lake’s surface using a manta net, throughout the water column using a plankton net, from lake sediments and in benthic organisms that inhabit the lake. Microplastic densities in lake surface, water column and sediment samples were comparable to abundances observed in published studies in nearby water bodies. Native and invasive bivalves were dissected to determine if microplastics were present. Minimal plastic contamination was observed in the native mussel species (<em>Elliptio complanata</em>) whereas up to twenty microplastic particles were observed in a dissected invasive Asian clam (<em>Corbicula fluminea</em>). Weekly analyses of microplastics in invasive clams identified a strong seasonal component to the prevalence and abundance of microplastics observed in these organisms.

To tackle the problem, the traits that favor their accretion across habitats must be identified. Seagrass meadows are key ecosystems of soft bottoms worldwide. Their leaves trap particles from the water column, favoring their burial into the sediment. Several studies have confirmed the presence of MP in these meadows’ sediments, but less light has been shed on the features that mediate their accrual. Here we studied the MP accumulation mediating role of seagrass epigeal structural complexity of an intermediate-sized species. Two replicated habitat types (vegetated, unvegetated-UV) and levels of structural complexity (high-HC, low-LC) were assessed in natural meadows (Canary Islands). Sedimentary MP abundance was determined from cores of superficial sediment. We found MPs in the sediments of all studied meadows, covering diverse shapes, sizes and colors, being the 1-2 mm transparent fibers the most profuse. MP abundance in the sediments inside HC meadows significantly exceeded that of their abutting UV sediments. MP abundance inside LC meadows equaled that of their abutting UV sediments, significantly exceeding that of UV sediments abutting HC meadows. Our results evince that epigeal structural complexity of seagrass meadows mediate their MP sink capacity. HC meadows function as enhanced sinks when compared to UV sediments. Conversely, LC meadows lack this boosted filtering capacity, and their abutting UV sediments function as enhanced MP sinks instead.",5,737,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

It is important to understand not only how plastics will possibly affect ecosystem functioning, but also how the ecosystem will influence the fate of plastics.

Plastic sheets <em>in situ </em>incubated over a seven-week period accumulated a thick biofilm including abundant pennate diatoms that contain biogenic silica and thus contribute to ballast. However, a model based on the measured maximum accumulated silica and varying plastic thicknesses suggests that not even a plastic sheet as thin as a plastic bag, and bio-fouled on both sides, would become negatively buoyant; and the same plastic as thin as cling film would become negatively buoyant in freshwater only and not in seawater.

To contribute to a research agenda on the effects of variability in aquatic systems, we identify the challenges and gaps of knowledge and propose how to approach variability from an experimental point of view while fostering integration with modeling approaches and aspects of experimental design. As an example of how to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and the relevance of fast (sub-daily) light fluctuations for a natural phytoplankton community, we conducted an experiment using indoor mesocosms and simulated four light scenarios: i. natural light conditions, ii. red-shifted conditions (same mean and total variance as in i., sub-daily fluctuations removed), iii. increased mean and variance (mean and total variance of i. increased by 20%), and iv. red-shifted increased mean and variance (sub-daily fluctuations of iii. removed, mean and total variance maintained). Phytoplankton biomass was highest in treatments with increased mean and variance, a result that might be expected as the experiment was conducted in autumn, and light availability might be limiting. Treatments including fast light fluctuations showed higher biomass than red-shifted ones. This result supports the idea that irradiance may be integrated under fast fluctuations while photosynthetic adjustments may occur under slower fluctuations and growth can be averaged between irradiance levels.",0,742,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

A way to cope with environmental fluctuations where&nbsp;predictable conditions affect several generations is&nbsp;through non-genetic transgenerational effects. Sexual reproduction in rotifers is inhibited in several generations after diapause, but no study relating this transgenerational effect to environmental predictability has been done, its molecular basis being also unknown. Hence, we studied (1) the proportion of sexual reproduction (PSR) along successive clonal generations from diapausing eggs in eight <em>Brachionus</em> <em>plicatilis</em> populations inhabiting ponds with different levels of environmental predictability, and (2) the expression level of genes related to sex in rotifers (17-β-estradiol dehydrogenase, <em>edh</em>) and epigenetic signaling mechanisms (DNA methyltransferase, <em>dnmt</em>) in a subset of populations in our study system. Results show that clones from more predictable ponds were unresponsive to sex-inducing cues for a higher&nbsp;number of generations after leaving diapause. Instead, clones from more unpredictable ponds did respond to sex-inducing cues from early generations, likely to ensure diapausing egg production. Besides, <em>edh</em> increased its expression across generations and correlated positively with PSR, suggesting that <em>edh</em> is involved in the manifestation of sex. Differences were neither found in the expression of <em>dnmt</em> among generations nor between populations, pointing out that methylation may not be involved in the observed transgenerational effect.",5,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Sala Ibiza B,

We investigated the response in maximum growth rate (r&lt;sub&gt;max/sub&gt;), biomass and stoichiometry of an assembled community consisting of three Antarctic phytoplankton species from key groups exposed to a 5 x 5 gradient of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply combined with two amplitudes of temperature fluctuation (± 0.5 and 1°C) around two different means (2°C and 5°C). Overall, phytoplankton growth rate and biomass was higher with increased N and P supply, indicating co-limitation of both nutrients. Biomass and growth rate decreased at elevated mean temperature under imbalanced nutrient supply conditions, indicating strong interactive effects of warming and nutrient conditions (ratios). At 2 °C, higher amplitude resulted in higher growth rate and biomass compared to low amplitude. At 5°C, increased amplitude resulted in lower growth<em> </em>and biomass at suboptimal N conditions. Phytoplankton N:P followed the supply ratio but decreased with increasing mean temperature and higher amplitude at N:P &gt; 40. Overall, our results indicate that increasing thermal fluctuation (amplitude) around an increasing mean will push polar phytoplankton closer to their maximum thermal tolerance.

However, warming will not occur in isolation from other abiotic environmental changes. Therefore, it is important to consider how these factors may interact with warming. There is a lack of a mechanistic understanding of how temperature and resource availability interact and shape communities. Using phytoplankton, a key component of all aquatic ecosystems, I aim to investigate if the temperature-sensitivities of resource-use traits are conserved across the tree of life or if they differ systematically among taxonomic or functional groups. Furthermore, I will evaluate if the temperature dependence of resource-use traits is fixed for individual species. For this purpose, 20 phytoplankton species from four Swiss lakes were isolated. I then performed resource requirement experiments according to Tilman's framework (&lt;em&gt;R*&lt;/em&gt; experiments), growing these species in 48 different conditions in which we manipulated one of three resources - nitrogen, phosphorus, and light, and temperatures – from 15°C to 35°C. The preliminary results show for every species, a temperature dependence on resource-use, usually, it is an increase of the resource requirements with temperature. However, these results do not show a general pattern that we can associate with functional groups for example. The change in resource requirements caused by warming may lead to modified competitive hierarchies, and thereby alter the outcome of competition in phytoplankton communities.",1,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Sala Ibiza B,

This, combined with multiple anthropogenic pressures, is affecting seagrass resilience. While the theory of resilience in seagrass is generally well-studied, the timeframes of recovery has received comparatively little attention. Whilst excluding grazers in a field experiment, we simulated different grazing intensities in two southwestern Australian estuaries during summer and tracked the recovery of seagrass over 3 months, using seagrass cover as the main measure of recovery. We have documented the time required for recovery following simulated grazing and characterised the variability in seagrass cover and recovery time as well as the mechanisms of recovery. Increased grazing intensity led to not only longer recovery times, but also greater variability in the recovery time among experimental locations. Some meadows may be more resilient than others, as the recovery time at some experimental sites was more than double the others. Both clonal growth and recruitment from vegetative fragments were the main recovery mechanisms, and the relative important varied between the two colonising species. As the pressure of climate change on estuarine environments increases, these recovery times suggest that these seagrasses will be resilient to increased grazing pressure into the future. This work also provides a baseline for understanding grazing pressure as a singular disturbance.&nbsp;&nbsp;",3,740,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Higher temperatures and prolonged water column stratification can favor cyanobacteria dominance, which even when not toxic or grazing resistant, lack phytosterols as precursors for cholesterol, the main sterol in animal tissues. Cholesterol is crucial for the physiological adaptation of ectotherms to high temperature. Therefore, a shift to cyanobacteria-dominated systems may increase the vulnerability of zooplankton to heatwaves by intensifying cholesterol limitation. We combine experimental and modelling approaches to predict the effects of cholesterol limitation on the cumulative mortality of the keystone genus <em>Daphnia </em>that could occur in a fluctuating environment over several days of heatwave. We show that increasing cholesterol limitation decreases the maximal temperature that <em>Daphnia </em>can withstand. Our simulations predict that, when facing heatwaves over several days, the differences in survival caused by cholesterol limitation build up rapidly. Our results suggest that the increasing risk of cholesterol limitation due to more frequent cyanobacterial blooms could compromise the resistance of zooplankton populations to future heatwaves.",1,743,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

We finally generated short-term thermal metabolic performance curves to explain growth responses observed in the long-term experiment. In a long-term mesocosm study, we show extremely warm conditions to select rare recruits capable of expressing increased metabolic suppression and recovery in response to daily fluctuations.

These changes have been attributed to the effect of biotic interactions, but few studies have tested this assumption. Here, we analyse the zooplankton community of a Mediterranean coastal wetland subjected to a restoration process that involved the creation of new lagoons. We analysed community dissimilarity patterns and used mixed graphical models to infer interaction networks from abundance data. Increasing differences in the community structure between new and old lagoons were detected from the second year after their creation.

An understanding of the sensory ecology of the predatory copepod Mesocyclops will allow us to disrupt mechanoreception or chemoreception using non-invasive methods. Caenorhabditis elegans was used as a substitute for D. medinensis due to their similarity in size and body flexion. The location of the nematode when attacked by the copepod provided a perceptive volume showing live worms often are captured close to the distal tips of the antennules (for both sexes), the presumed location of mechanoreceptors. Live worms were also captured in the caudal region for male copepods, suggesting the presence of mechanoreceptors for males in this region. In contrast, dead prey, more likely detectable by their odor, are captured near their mouth for both sexes, the presumed location of chemoreceptors. SEM analysis shows that distal tips of the antennules have long hair-like setae, considered mechanoreceptive in copepods. Male copepods also contain shorter setules on the medial terminal setae that do not exist for female copepods which may be used for mechanoreception.

Furthermore, invasive <em>Aedes</em> species are continuously spreading in Europe and have been increasingly reported from urban settlements. Some of these mosquito species have been associated with small artificial habitats, e.g., dark plastic containers. Therefore, we could also expect their presence in small plastic garden ponds, which are numerous in urban settings in several parts of Europe. In this study, our aim was to understand the potential abiotic and biotic drivers of the presence of mosquitoes within the macroinvertebrate communities in urban ponds. We sampled 54 public urban ponds in Budapest (Hungary) of both natural and anthropogenic origin and 40 garden ponds which cover both highly urbanized areas and those with high green index in the suburbs. We collected data on the macroinvertebrate communities of these ponds as well as data on management along with physico-chemical parameters and pond features (mainly morphology and vegetation cover) measured in situ during spring 2022. While we did not find any invasive mosquitoes in the 94 ponds, several other species were present, including <em>Anopheles plumbeus</em>, a potential malaria host spreading in urban environments.

For plankton, this behavior is generally assumed to be artificially produced in a lab. This behavior was tested for Hesperodiaptomis shoshone, a freshwater alpine copepod that is the top predator in its environment. For all preys tested (Moina belli, Daphnia magna., Daphnia middendorfiana, and Leptodiaptomis sp.), H. shoshone exhibited a pattern of surplus killing, positively correlating to prey density. Filming data showed that male H. shoshone demonstrated strong consumptive preference for live prey while females exhibit preference for dead prey. Additionally, H. shoshone’s handling time to consume live M. belli (30.3 seconds) was significantly greater than the handling time to eat a carcass (4.5 seconds). Theoretically, female H. shoshone expend less energy consuming carcasses than they would consuming live prey. One possible explanation for this behavior is that surplus killing evolved to allow females to conserve energy during egg production.

This crustacean group is characterised by relatively large body size, broad feeding spectrum and high consumption rates, and thus likely plays an important role in temporary water ecosystems. To bridge unfavourable periods within their habitats, anostracans form resting cysts resistant to a wide range of environmental conditions. In addition, they mostly disperse passively as resting cysts that can be picked up by wind and animals, such as birds or amphibians. In this study, we aim to reconstruct and collect information on genetic diversification and distribution history of several anostracan species. Moreover, we assess the factors determining the distribution range of anostracan species inhabiting several continents. We combine genetic data (using the mitochondrial COI gene region) and a diverse set of traits for each individual anostracan species to determine the factors influencing their past and present geographic distribution. As anostracan species differ considerably in their distribution range and habitat preferences, we hypothesise that their traits like the body length or the habitat type are playing a key role in their dispersal range and ability to establish at a new habitat. This work could also be of value for predicting the dynamics of temporary water communities as it is expected that the number and size of temporary water systems will change in the future due to climate change and human influence.",3,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Menorca B,

GHG emissions from WSPs also strongly depend on the physical and chemical properties of pond itself, external environment, and operating conditions and show high spatial and temporal variability, which is also expected that pond systems are potential hotspot of GHGs due to their high and regular organic loading and varies physical characteristics. However, compared with the large number of studies on GHG emission from other water systems, there are only few studies on this area in WSPs, and lack of comprehensive review on comparing GHG emission from these similar water systems.

In Mediterranean regions, ponds are highly vulnerable because they suffer from two major impacts related to anthropogenic stress: pollution and climate change effects, such as drought, which both may affect litter decomposition. The aim of this project was to quantify the potential microbial litter decomposition in Mediterranean ponds and to identify the main drivers for their variability, to be able to predict changes in litter decomposition potential under global change. We measured litter decomposition potential in 30 ponds, which are located in areas under different human pressure (pond status categories: low, medium and high) and water intermittency (permanent and temporary ponds), during three sampling periods. We used the tea-bag index approach, incubating the standardized organic substrates for approximately 80 days measured the main environmental variables. We did not find significant differences in the percentage of organic matter among pond status categories. However, temporary ponds tended to have less organic matter loss in comparison to permanent ponds.

Although organic agriculture is promoted as a more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional agriculture, how impacts differ between both farming systems is still debated. Comparative studies focus mainly on terrestrial systems and rivers, whereas small lentic waterbodies, like ponds, are ignored. This is despite the fact that ponds are abundant in agricultural landscapes, largely contribute to regional biodiversity, and are very sensitive to environmental change. Here we compare the impact of conventional and organic agriculture on biodiversity and evolutionary trajectories of pond biota. First, we compared α, β and γ-diversity of macrophytes, zooplankton and macroinvertebrates in ponds located in organic and conventional farms. We found a moderately positive effect of organic farming on aquatic biodiversity, particularly for macrophytes and at larger spatial scales, but the variation in biodiversity among ponds irrespective of agricultural type indicates that other factors such as land use intensity might be more important for biodiversity. Then, we assessed whether <em>Daphnia magna</em> populations from organic and conventional farmland ponds genetically adapt to specific types of pesticides used in each agriculture type.

Our results showed a fast colonization of the species with active dispersion since they dominated the communities right after lagoon creation (Diptera). In contrast, species with passive dispersion (Gastropoda and Amphipoda) that have a lower dispersive capacity were dominant at the last sampling survey, 5 years after creation. This could be explained by flooding periods that connect all wetland waterbodies favouring the arrival of both, active and passive dispersers.

Decreasing connectivity hinders dispersal among communities, changing biotic interaction networks, and eventually leading to the extinction of less competitive species. Thus, in isolated patches, species richness might decrease, while their contribution to beta diversity increase. In contrast, communities in central locations, more prone to mass effects, are expected to have more complex biotic interaction networks, because resources are not locally limited but subsidized by the ones of nearby. This would in turn increase community stability and would locally reduce the strength of biotic interactions. To test it, we have used data from a regional lake monitoring carried out from 1995 to 2015 (60 lakes in Sweden), and calculated the temporal species turnover, uniqueness, stability and biotic interactions of phytoplankton and invertebrates. We have then combined this information with the centrality metrics and the available environmental data from each monitored lake within a lake network obtained from a global lake database. Our preliminary results showed that the number of biotic interactions was positively related to species richness, turnover, and uniqueness, but negatively related to community stability.

Siders Pond is a meromictic system in Massachusetts, USA with steep chemical gradients that support a diverse array of microbial redox reactions and communities. Due to saltwater input at depth from Vineyard Sound (Atlantic Ocean) and the freshwater surface layer, Siders remains highly stratified, with a chemocline which results in oxic, transition, and anoxic zones. Furthermore, decreasing levels of dissolved oxygen and increasing ammonium and hydrogen sulfide at depth promote distinct microenvironments that mimic the complex chemistry and diversity of deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

Observations were motivated by examination of the spatial and temporal distribution of Environmental DNA, but also have broader ecological and biogeochemical implications, because ponds are characterized by high biodiversity and intense biogeochemical processing. &nbsp;Two distinct layers were observed, with very different patterns of transport and mixing. In the upper “Surface Mixed Layer” (SML), currents reached a few cm/s, flowing downwind near the surface and upwind near the SML base. Vertical turbulent mixing was sufficient to homogenize this layer in about 0.5 hours, comparable to the time required for currents to transport water across the pond. Below the SML, in a “Stratified Layer” (SL), mm/s currents usually reversed several times per hour, gravity held light warm water above cold dense water, and vertical turbulent mixing was negligible. Nightly free convection increased SML depth to &gt;1 m, whereas daytime heating often reduced SML depth to &lt;0.5 m, with the shallowest depths observed near the upwind shore. Implications for biogeochemical transport are discussed. Observations suggest that the deeper (&gt;1.6 m) regions of observed ponds were not ventilated through most of the summer, although creation of bottom water by preferential cooling in shallows may complicate this theory. The small SML thickness, and the similarity of timescales for vertical mixing and lateral advection, both suggest that applicability of popular one-dimensional vertical parameterizations for surface fluxes may be limited to shallow depths in small water bodies. A simple parameterization for SML depth is shown to be useful for distinguishing the upper region of rapid transport and mixing from the lower, quiescent layer.",0,,6/5/23 10:30,6/5/23 12:00,Sala Menorca B,

It has, hence, mostly focused on technical/scientific questions, disregarding the importance of understanding the social dynamics behind carbon markets, essential for efficient ecosystem management. Climate change is viewed more as a technological challenge than a social/political problem rooted in a system based on unjustified profiteering.

The global significance of seagrass meadows at storing organic carbon, however, depends on whether the meadows are helping to preserve carbon which would otherwise be broken down and remineralised into CO<sub>2</sub>. By combining both physical and biogeochemical measures, we elucidate the actual net effect of&nbsp;<em>Zostera marina&nbsp;</em>meadows on coastal carbon storage and sequestration. Under increasing bed shear stress levels, it was found that dense&nbsp;<em>Z. marina&nbsp;</em>meadows prevent sediment resuspension, and consequently, organic carbon remobilisation. This physical process of carbon retention results in higher sedimentary carbon loads within&nbsp;seagrass&nbsp;meadows, but does this trapping affect the preservation of the organic carbon? Using biogeochemical measures of carbon reactivity in natural sandy sediments from an established&nbsp;<em>Z. marina</em>&nbsp;meadow, we determined that bulk organic carbon beneath the seagrass meadow had a decay constant ranging from 0.2-0.6 year<sup>-1</sup>. When resuspended, however, the decay constant of the same bulk carbon was 0.6-0.7 year<sup>-1</sup>. Thus, while seagrass meadows physically trap organic carbon within sandy sediments of the coastal zone, this process only appears to have a minimal impact on the preservation of organic carbon.

However, there is still contention in using these estimates for policy making due to uncertainties in the origin of the OC, with large uncertainties about the relative importance of allochtonous vs autochtonous contributions. In this work, we explored the potential of DNA metabarcoding to determine the main sources of seagrass sedimentary OC, particularly for older sedimentary levels (up to 1 m). As a case study we used long-term stable meadows located in Ria Formosa and in the Sado estuary and restored meadows located in the Sado/Arrábida coast, Portugal. DNA metabarcoding of sediments of natural meadows suggested a dominance of autochtonous seagrass OC for the natural meadows (60%). However, allochtonous OC from diatoms and macroalgae was a major contributor for all sediment cores, particularly in the case of restored seagrass meadows, with estimated contributions from 30 to 70%. Restored seagrass meadows showed larger variations in OC sources along time suggesting that seagrass meadow stability is important to maximize autochtonous carbon contributions.

There is emerging evidence that the source of buried organic carbon (i.e. allochthonous vs autochthonous) may alter the effectiveness of BC deposits, but little is known about how climate change will impact this. We investigated how fjordic carbon burial is affected by climate change scenarios (warming and acidification) projected for the end of the century in the context of carbon source. Using Scotland as a model system, fjordic organic carbon stocks were observed to vary 10-fold between fjord types, with sheltered fjords storing more organic carbon. Under future conditions, the effects of climate change on organic carbon burial was sensitive the carbon source, with labile carbon (more biodegradable) being more vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand, refractory carbon (less biodegradable) was less vulnerable to future conditions. These differences were more pronounced in summer than in winter. The future capacity for BC hotspots to bury and store carbon may therefore be driven by both the prevailing carbon source of the time and historical legacies of carbon source variability. We conclude that a two-pronged risk exists for buried organic carbon over the coming century: 1) enhanced remineralisation of recently buried carbon at higher temperatures, and 2) the effectiveness of future burial hotspots depends on the interaction between allochthonous carbon sources and the extent of global change.",7,761,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

These estuaries sequester atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at globally significant rates per unit area through blue carbon burial. Sequestration is largely controlled by the balance between marsh GPP, OC decomposition on the marsh, allochthonous OC deposition, and OC export to tidal waters. Eddy flux tower measures of marsh metabolism adjusted for lateral inorganic C fluxes determine marsh net ecosystem production (NEP), and help constrain estimates of sequestration and OC export to tidal waters. Rates of marsh primary production are similar between these two systems, yet a greater proportion is buried in Plum Island marsh soils (42%) than in the Duplin, where more is exported to tidal waters (80%). Carbon budgets show marsh OC burial is subsidized by allochthonous OC in both systems, which strictly speaking is not “blue” carbon. The estuaries consume far more organic carbon than is produced within the aquatic portion of these systems: tidal wetlands are a major source of organic carbon fueling estuarine heterotrophy with minor contributions from the ocean and terrestrial watersheds. Both systems export excess organic carbon to the ocean.

Yet, vast areas of estuarine saltmarshes have been totally or partially transformed during the last century due to human interventions (e.g. tidal restriction and land reclamation), leading to changes in both the community structure and the ecological functions. Within the scope of the European project LIFE ADAPTA BLUES, we retrospectively assessed the impact of tidal restriction and/or land reclamation in estuarine saltmarshes carbon sinks and soil accretion rates. We do so by examining differences in soil accumulation rates, and organic carbon&nbsp;sequestration rates during the last century across saltmarshes under different levels of human transformation in the north of Spain. Soil and C<sub>org</sub> accumulation rates since 1960 across saltmarshes examined ranged from 0.09 to 0.29 cm y<sup>-1</sup> and from 6 to 109 g C<sub>org</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The results found show that tidal restriction impacted C<sub>org</sub> storage and the capacity of saltmarshes to adapt to sea level rise by reducing between 70 and 95 % the C<sub>org</sub> accumulation rates and between 75 and 81% the sediment accretion rates of transformed saltmarshes, compared to non-transformed ones.

We also independently develop GEDI predictions of mangrove carbon storage, applying them to nearly three million GEDI measurements globally. Finally, we use our global maps of mangrove forest carbon to show the sensitivity of these forests to a suite of environmental factors (e.g. stand density, temperature, salinity, etc.).

However, many seagrass meadows are found in tropical to subtropical latitudes, where sediment formation can be dominated by carbonates (IC). The CO<sub>2</sub> production resulting from IC formation (dissolution) within seagrass meadows may offset (enhance) their potential as C sinks. Here, we examine OC and IC burial fluxes of South Florida seagrass meadows using 18 <sup>210</sup>Pb-dated sediment cores spanning a range of geomorphic settings from estuarine to backreef environments. We find considerable variability in sediment C stocks across the seascape, with spatial decoupling of C stocks and C burial rate hotspots. Through analysis of C stable isotopes and other auxiliary data, we estimate the proportion of autochthonous OC and IC production and derive first-order estimates of net benthic C fluxes. We find that particularly meadows in Florida Bay are likely net C sources to the atmosphere, supporting recent findings from eddy covariance measurements. We go on to evaluate the relative importance of seagrass condition versus seascape configuration for benthic OC, IC, and net C burial fluxes, adding to the conceptual framework for blue carbon potential in carbonate-dominated seagrass meadows.",2,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Sala Palma,

Coastal conservation planners and decision makers therefore call for large-scale ecosystem-based management approaches to maximize the effect of the critical blue carbon ecosystem service. Typically, the discipline of landscape ecology provides an efficient spatially oriented conceptual framework to assess the influence of seascape configuration and connectivity on blue carbon sink capacity within coastal seascapes. With focus on multiscale seascape ecology concepts, we synthesized lessons learned from blue carbon research in tropical western Indian Ocean and temperate northern Europe. Insights from this research indicate that blue carbon hotspots have been identified within seascapes comprised of large continuous blue forest ecosystems (such as extensive seagrass meadows and mangroves). Strong land-to-sea gradients generate distinct patterns in blue carbon stock dynamics and source compositions. Land-use changes (urban development, deforestation, and habitat degradation) in the land-sea interface alter the supply and movement patterns of blue carbon in coastal seascapes.

Recent studies demonstrated that the spatial variability of the OC&nbsp;stocks and sequestration rates&nbsp;within the same wetland system can be significant. Some of the environmental drivers of this spatial variability remain understudied and their specific importance can be site dependent. Here we investigated the role of bed elevation, hydrodynamics (e.g., current velocity), and vegetation habitat type (salt marshes and seagrasses) on the sedimentary OC stocks &nbsp;at the mesotidal wetland of the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, in South Portugal. Results showed that two vectors of spatial variation need to be considered to obtain accurate blue carbon maps: (1) the bed elevation that imposes a decrease of the hydroperiod and thus the zonation of vegetation species and habitats, and (2) the spatial variation along the channels of the lagoon, which imposes a gradient in the current flow velocity magnitude. This allowed us to create the first blue carbon map of the Ria Formosa lagoon by combining site-specific hydrodynamic datasets, wetland habitat distribution, and sediment geochemical data (OC stocks and sequestration rates) for intertidal seagrasses and saltmarshes. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering multiple environmental drivers and spatial variability for regional estimations of blue carbon stocks in wetlands.",5,,6/9/23 8:30,6/9/23 10:00,Sala Palma,

Roesler and Barnard’s Line Height Absorption (LHA) method developed in year 2013 is a popular method often used to estimate chlorophyll concentrations from high frequency absorption measurements. The slope of the relationship between absorption and chlorophyll concentration is known as the chlorophyll-specific absorption line height (a<sub>LH</sub>*). The a<sub>LH</sub>* varies with phytoplankton community composition and pigment packaging, and while the importance of regional tuning is accounted for, the effect of seasonality on a<sub>LH</sub>* is not. The following evaluates the impact of temporal or seasonal variability on the LHA. The study was carried out in the Northern Gulf of Alaska (NGA), which is intensely seasonal. It was found that the a<sub>LH</sub>* for the NGA ranged between 0.0108 and 0.0136, with the highest values occurring in summer and the lowest in spring. This translates into a non-negligible 26% variability in chlorophyll estimates. The size fractionated chlorophyll data strongly suggests that a shift in the phytoplankton size is a major driver of the a<sub>LH</sub>* variability between spring and summer. Given these results, we encourage others to consider the seasonality factor when using the LHA method to obtain chlorophyll estimates from absorption measurements.",4,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

However, there is growing evidence that some marine organisms (including elephant seals, frigatebirds, penguins) may select for Lagrangian and not just Eulerian features. Lagrangian predictors can capture filaments, eddies, and fronts as well as along-trajectory processes such as accumulation of biomass that cannot easily be extracted from Eulerian fields. These features have the potential to reveal preferred habitats for marine species. This is important, as it will strengthen our capacity to predict where marine predators are, thus enabling to design more precise and dynamic conservation and fisheries management plans. Here, we present a method that tests for the selection for Lagrangian features in marine predators. We use HYCOM, a global data-constrained ocean circulation model to compute two different Lagrangian predictors, Finite-Time Lypanuov Exponent (FTLE) and dilation rate. We then couple these predictors with the TOPP (Tracking of Pacific Predators) dataset to assess the selection of Lagrangian features by 42 different species of marine predators, ranging from sea turtles to sharks, elephant seals, and whales.",0,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,

This is done, in part by mesoscale and sub mesoscale oceanographic features transporting and locally concentrating plankton, creating patchy regions of high prey availability. Lagrangian approaches applied to coastal ocean dynamics can identify the transport features responsible for plankton patchiness, linking highly nonlinear coastal flow to the spatial ecology of food webs. This study employs two Lagrangian coherent structure approaches, Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE) and Relative Particle Density (RPD), to coastal surface currents observed by High Frequency Radars (HFR) around a known biological hotspot, Palmer Deep Antarctica. FTLE and RPD results were compared to the spatial ecology of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and foraging penguins, relating each level of the food web to lagrangian transport. Simultaneous measurements of the physics and food web were gathered through the integration of vessel and autonomous glider surveys within the HFR footprint. Results show FTLE better define borders of plankton patches while RPD better define centers of plankton patches that are then targeted by penguins. Transport features quantified by FTLE and RPD deliver and concentrate constant supplies of plankton, maintaining prey resources.

The importance of resource retention by a subsurface eddy for maintaining an Antarctic biological hotspot.,"Food resources in the ocean are dilute, therefore they must be concentrated for carbon to be passed up the food web. This can be accomplished through local population growth, transport, or aggregating behavior. Biological hotspots in which local growth is a dominant factor in accumulating food resources operate more like “farms”, producing food locally. In contrast, biological hotspots in which Lagrangian transport, advection and retention are dominant factors operate more like “markets”, concentrating food resources produced in other regions. Here, we show that in Palmer Deep Canyon, a biological hotspot in the West Antarctic Peninsula likely operates like a market as opposed to a farm. This hotspot contains a bathymetrically driven sub-surface eddy that retains biogenic particles below the mixed layer, a potential food source for grazers. In simulations, this eddy also traps diel vertically migrating zooplankton, keeping them retained in the region, and within close foraging distance from regional penguin colonies. Simulations further show that in the absence of this eddy, krill delivery rates to penguin foraging areas are significantly reduced, showing the importance of the retention of food resources to the local ecology. Regions that have the ability to attract and concentrate food resources may serve as refuges in a rapidly changing climate.",0,775,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

A comparison between historical and recent data reveals significant inter-annual differences in phenology, aiming us at understanding involved environmental factors and consequences on reserve replenishment and spill-over. Using a Lagrangian model tuned with phenological observations, we map dispersal pathways of larvae to and from the reserve, to assess spatial extent of larval sources and sinks.

Mechanisms controlling the offshore transport of freshwater in the Labrador Sea can play an important role in stratification, circulation, and primary production. Many recent studies have investigated transport processes in the region based on model simulations. Investigating ocean dynamics off Greenland based on observations is challenging because in situ data are sparse, however. Here, we use satellite observations of sea surface salinity (SSS) and surface ocean currents to characterize freshwater content and to provide a Lagrangian view of transport pathways in the Labrador Sea over multiple years. We compare observations from different satellites to investigate how salinity variability in a narrow coastal band off west Greenland is captured by these different products. Despite limitations under cold water conditions, our analyses indicate that satellite SSS can capture the influence of meltwater input and associated freshwater plumes off coastal west Greenland, although those representations differ between products.

We examine and model the patterns of velocities, turbulence, and suspended sediment concentrations from unique flow-following measurements along a tidally influenced river, collected along the heavily sediment-laden Kaipara River with a novel ‘floc-drifter’ platform. The flow-following dataset provided excellent spatial resolution and captured variability across scales not resolved by Eulerian measurements. While Eulerian numerical model predictions were classified as excellent, when explored in the more stringent Lagrangian framework, the results highlighted areas of deficiencies in model performance, with larger discrepancies between observations and predictions occurring at bends. Model predictions of hydrodynamic quantities were not found to be particularly sensitive to the turbulence closure scheme applied, although overall, the simpler k-l scheme performed better than more sophisticated k-eps scheme.

On the west coast, the reef runs from north to south, extending over 800 km in latitude. The northern range edge was highly fragmented and partially lost during the 2011 marine heatwave, with little to no recovery. The poleward flowing Leeuwin Current is the main driver for kelp dispersal and connectivity between the reef systems in this region and can typically transport drifting material over 200 km within 30 days. Kelp can disperse in two main ways: through dispersal of zoospores and detached fertile material. Detached fertile drift material can disperse over longer distances and provides the greatest potential connectivity between reef systems. However, detached kelp material decomposes over time, and laboratory experiments show that decomposition rates vary significantly with temperature, from the order of several days in warm conditions to hundreds of days in cool conditions. This potentially has considerable implications for the connectivity of kelp reef systems under anthropogenic warming conditions. Here we combine Lagrangian particle tracking simulations with known kelp decomposition rates to show how the connectivity between kelp reefs along the west coast of Australia will change under future climate change scenarios. We show that connectivity may decrease with warming, which has implications for the resilience of kelp forests, potentially limiting processes such as genetic rescue and the recovery of lost kelp forests following extreme events.",2,,6/5/23 8:30,6/5/23 10:00,Sala Ibiza B,

The model resolves patch dilution and internal physical mixing as a function of oceanic strain and diffusion. Ecological dynamics are parameterized by an idealized nutrient and phytoplankton population and we specifically capture the propagation of the biochemical spatial variances to represent within-patch heterogeneity.

The most important crossroads intercepted plastic debris from multiple sources, which had often traveled long distances. During its travel, plastic debris can be colonised by marine organisms, and eventually sink. We found that the locations where debris leaves the surface are significantly different from those where it reaches the seafloor: debris travels hundreds of kilometers during its sinking.

Understanding the ocean dynamics that affect their trajectories is vital to simulate their pathways, and thus know their sources and sinks. This can then be used to implement clean-up strategies and to better manage MPAs. It can also help reduce the impact of ocean pollution on the marine environment and some major economic sectors like tourism. High frequency motions have an important impact on the surface dynamics, but high temporal resolution data is necessary to study their effects. New datasets and methodologies have allowed to obtain better representations of high frequency motions. Here, we specifically focus on the high frequency motions due to tides (like for example internal waves), as well as inertial oscillations. We simulate surface trajectories of plastic, oil and <em>Sargassum</em>. We focus on three regions in the Atlantic Ocean: Açores Islands, North Atlantic and Tropical Atlantic, respectively. For the plastic simulations we look at the effect of tides by using velocity outputs from a high-resolution model which is a twin simulation without and with tidal forcing. For the oil spills and <em>Sargassum</em> outputs we use a new surface currents product generated by combining velocity data from drifters, high-frequency winds and altimetry to reconstruct high-frequency surface currents. We find that considering high-frequency motions is key to correctly simulate their surface trajectories, but that further work is necessary to understand the ocean dynamics at the fine-scales that can drive the variability in these Lagrangian trajectories.",9,772,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Here, we present a large data set on circulation patterns in the North Sea with a focus on the frontal systems in the Skagerrak – the transition area between the Baltic and North Sea. The data set encompasses measurements obtained from Lagrangian surface drifters which were deployed during several cruises between 2017 to 2021. Our research group at the ICBM (University of Oldenburg) designed the low-cost drifters for studying coastal dynamics and exchange processes in tidal systems. We also used clusters of drifters to analyze in detail fine sub-mesoscale fluid dynamics, such as divergence and eddy dynamics.&nbsp; Based on the large data set, we provide high-resolution surface current maps and show representations of tidal dynamics in the North Sea. Our data reveal significant differences between the mostly shallow areas of the North Sea and the deep Skagerrak. While tidal currents dominate the shallow coastal areas, deep areas are characterized by a high mean residual circulation driven by high density gradients. The data sets are well suited for model validation and further studies on sea surface dynamics in frontal zones including mixing processes.

A mechanistic understanding of these dynamics has been hindered by limited depth-resolved and temporal sampling, and by methods that obscure dynamics on individual particles. Here, we analyze microbial communities on ~400 individual sinking particles in conjunction with more conventional composite particle samples to observe how particle colonization and community assembly might control carbon sequestration in the deep ocean. We observed significant differences in community composition depending on particle collection method, demonstrating sampling method should closely match the questions being addressed. Additionally, we observed community succession with corresponding changes in metagenome assembled genome-based metabolic potential on the large sinking particles that transport a significant fraction of carbon to the deep sea. An existing model framework of community dynamics associated with sinking particles suggests that the observed succession patterns on individual particles were influenced by changes in community turnover rates and particle lability.

Here, we augment metagenomic sequencing with a proximity-linkage method, Hi-C, in which DNA within a cell is bound and then sequenced to bin assembled contigs based on physical proximity, therefore linking viral and host sequence when found in the same cell. This technique was applied to a size-fractioned water sample from beneath the euphotic zone in an hypoxic estuarine fjord in Puget Sound, WA to generate Hi-C Assembled Genomes (HAGs) of both particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) microbial communities and link viruses with microbial cells. Within the PA size fraction, three bins contained photoautotrophic sequences, two <em>Synechococcus</em> and one <em>Haptophyta,&nbsp;</em>with viral sequence, identified as either cyanophage or phycodnaviridae. These data suggest infected photoautotrophs were delivered to depth on particles, supporting the viral shuttle hypothesis. Furthermore, in the FL community one of these cyanophage, a <em>Synechococcus</em> S-CAM7-like virus, was within a large HAG containing a <em>Gammaproteobacteria </em>closely related to <em>Alcanivorax</em>. This interaction of a cyanomyovirus with a<em> </em>heterotroph cannot be classified as a lytic infection with these data, but suggests viruses may enter a much broader range of cells than those they have been demonstrated to reproduce in.

The latest significant fish kill event occurred in August 2020. <em>Microcystis</em> cf. <em>wesenbergii </em>and <em>Spirulina subsalsa</em> were the two numerically dominant cyanobacteria, with average cell densities of 320,000 cells/mL.&nbsp; Diatom densities were 2-4 orders of magnitude lower than cyanobacterial densities and no zooplankton species (which are known occur) were not observed in the subsamples. The event coincided with a significant increase in nutrient (i.e., TN, and TP) concentrations relative to current mesotrophic-eutrophic values. In fact, an inverse relationship between copepods’ and <em>Microcystis</em>’ relative abundances with TP was observed; this, and lower conductivity values, suggest that the event was caused by a significant nutrient-enriched discharge of freshwater.

However, since the first description of <em>C. punctatum</em>, the eco-phyological characteristics of this species remain largely unknown. This study examined the effects of different temperature, salinity and nutrient (nitrate and phosphate) levels on growth of <em>C. punctatum,</em> and toxin contents and profiles of <em>C. punctatum</em> cultivated at different temperature and salinity levels were also investigated. <em>C. punctatum</em> had a narrow temperature for growth (15-25°C), with an optimal temperature of 20 °C, and could grow in a wide salinity range of 25-40, indicating that this species prefers warm waters for the growth and exhibits a strong tolerance to high salinity and that temperature occupies a more important regulatory role in the growth of <em>C. punctatum</em>, rather than salinity. The growth rates of <em>C. punctatum</em> cultivated at different temperarure and salinity levels were low, ranged from 0.09 to 0.12 day <sup>-1</sup> and from 0.10 to 0.17 day <sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In nutrient-addition experiments, the growth of <em>C. punctatum</em> is not significantly stimulated by nitrate additions, whereas this species seems to have high phosphate requirement for the growth. The growth characteristics of <em>C. punctatum</em> could be the results of adpaptive responses to the environmental conditions of ECS characterized by several different hydrographic waters.

Four years of daily data from an underwater dual-magnification darkfield microscope, combined with ancillary monitoring sensors, allowed to study the timing and relative importance of water physics and chemistry, small and large grazers on phytoplankton community abundances. Using machine learning (random forest) we show that bottom-up and top-down controls fluctuate over time, with shifting relative importance across seasons and years. Our results highlight the crucial role of microzooplankton species in controlling phytoplankton abundances during seasonal progressions. This is particularly relevant in a constantly warming world, where the role of consumers in maintaining food-web stability will increase in importance.

Although it’s long been accepted that algal growth is frequently limited by supplies of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) in freshwater, nutrient concentrations alone or in combination with other factors have had limited success in predicting cyanobacterial abundance and particularly, toxin development. It is currently unclear how trace metals, required for a wide range of cellular processes, may influence cyanobacteria growth and toxin formation in freshwater. We joined a limited number of studies that used nutrient amendment bioassays to determine how the presence of iron (Fe) would affect cyanobacterial densities and cyanotoxin concentration in relation to N and P. Fe plays a catalytic role in both nitrogen assimilation and chlorophyll synthesis by acting as a cofactor of necessary enzymes and proteins. Enrichment experiments with N (NaNO3), P (K2HPO4) and Fe (FeCl3) treatments were run individually and crossed (N/P, N/Fe, P/Fe, N/P/Fe) to determine any modifying role Fe has on algal growth in N and P enrichments. Algal biomass showed strong N and P co-limitation when no Fe was present. However, Fe additions altered this co-limitation by increasing algal biomass in relation to N enrichment but not in relation to P enrichment, strengthening the effect of N on algal growth. The results of this study suggest that understanding cyanobacterial bloom formation and toxin production will require a better understanding of metal ions in freshwater.",5,789,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In contrast, experimental evidence of plant chemicals repelling grazers, presented from at least 1888, had very little effect on terrestrial plant science until the 1950s. However, by the end of the 1970s the evidence was comprehensive and generally accepted, but is in many ways still viewed as secondary to nutrient (resource) availability. Since then a similar paradigm shift has occurred for marine macroalgae, and later for phytoplankton. Grazing pressure on phytoplankton is (i) several orders of magnitude higher than for terrestrial plants and macroalgae, (ii) likely represents the strongest selective pressure acting on them, and (iii) usually results in their immediate death. Nonetheless, the relative importance of nutrients and grazers in controlling secondary metabolite production of phytoplankton is not known. To address this knowledge gap we conducted a multilevel mixed-effects meta-analysis of 113 effects from 37 peer-reviewed articles, comparing the effects of nitrogen abundance/phosphorus limitation with grazing and grazer cues on toxin formation in <em>Alexandrium</em> spp. and <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> spp. We found that nutrient availability and grazing pressure increased phycotoxins with 267% (95% CI: 125 - 498) and 388% (230 - 622) respectively and that this effect can differ between the two genera.

The suitability of PRISMA radiance and reflectance products was demonstrated (Giardino et al. 2020; Braga et al. 2022) through comparison with reference data: Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 and in-situ measurements obtained through ad-hoc campaigns, where reflectance and water quality data are collected simultaneously. To demonstrate the PRISMA water quality mapping two approaches were tested: the bio-optical model inversion with the BOMBER code and adaptive semi-empirical algorithms. Bottom substrate (BS) maps were generated by running BOMBER, Total Suspended Matter (TSM) maps with the semi-empirical algorithms and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) maps with both approaches. The validation of the water quality products was performed by comparison with in-situ data. The maps obtained with BOMBER showed an accuracy of 80% for the characterization of the BS and RMSE=2.0 mgm<sup>-3</sup> for Chl-a retrieval. The maps obtained with the semi-empirical algorithms showed the following results: RMSE=1.9 gm<sup>-3</sup> for TSM retrieval and RMSE=3.1 mgm<sup>-3</sup> for Chl-a retrieval. Despite the need of further analysis, PRISMA is providing valuable information and - in synergy with multispectral missions - is offering support to water management activities.",0,802,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

It focuses on the succession and the expansion of the GOCI mission, and improves specifications over GOCI in terms of spatial, temporal and the spectral resolution. GOCI have effectively monitored water quality around Korean peninsula for the past decade in terms of chlorophyll-a concentrations (CHL), total suspended sediment (TSS), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) along with sea surface salinity (SSS). GOCI could get images in hourly base, making it possible to examine the diurnal variability of water quality. Now we have GOCI-II which has advanced spatial resolution (250 m), frequency (10 times a day) and spectral resolution (12 VNIR bands) for the previous one. Thus, we can get enhanced images in terms of time and space for the coastal waters around Korean peninsula and, consequently see more accurate dynamic variability in water quality. Here, we examined the applicability of GOCI-II to monitoring the diurnal variability in the water quality in Korean coastal waters in terms of the fundamental products like remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), chlorophyll-a concentrations (CHL) products by OCx algorithm, and total suspended sediment (TSS), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). We verified the algorithm by comparing with in-situ measurement and also with those from GOCI. Although GOCI has completed its mission at the end of March 2021, we have the duplicated times of operating GOCI-I, GOCI-II from February 2020 to March 2021. From this study, we examined and effectively identified the diurnal variability of water quality of Korean coastal waters.",4,795,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

This study investigates the temporal evolution of the in situ remote sensing reflectance <em>R<sub>RS</sub></em> during these blooms, benefitting from multispectral measurements from the Ocean Colour component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC). Spectral features that may show potential to identify cyanobacteria and their development stages are investigated. The capability and uncertainties in reproducing these features by the Ocean Colour products of Copernicus Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) are also assessed. Satellite derived <em>R<sub>RS</sub></em> values are compared to AERONET-OC radiometric data, showing high uncertainties particularly pronounced at the blue centre-wavelengths. On the other hand, band-differences in the green-red spectral region exhibit less dependence on atmospheric correction issues with mean absolute relative differences comprised between 8.3% and 9.6%, when considering data affected by the presence of cyanobacteria. A first comparison with in situ data of phytoplankton biovolume shows the potential for these band differences to identify cyanobacteria near-surface presence also at lower concentrations respect to other existing algorithms, being at the same time not sensitive to algal blooms usually occurring in spring.",2,,6/9/23 10:30,6/9/23 12:00,Sala Menorca A,

The golden tides (<em>Sargassum horneri</em>) appear mainly in the YS and ECS, but become entangled as they drift. The floating harmful macroalgae blooms (HMBs) obstructs navigation and is a huge socioeconomic problem in the vicinity of coastal areas. However, the annual pattern of <em>Sargassum</em> bloom is not well known due to changing air-sea interaction conditions. To determine the spatio-temporal distribution and variation of the golden tide in the YS and ECS, the multi-satellite sensor data (e.g. Sentinel-2 and GOCI) was used to detect the floating macroalgae patch using the Alternative Floating Algae Index and mapped over the study area using a 15-year data. The floating patches detected by both satellite data were overlapped to make the annual pattern maps. The <em>Sargassum</em> blooms were generally found on spring in the YS and ECS. The <em>Sargassum</em> blooms was proceeded in the waters near the Yangtze River and Zhejiang Province, China and then floating into the east and north-east ward influenced by the Tsushima warm current or Kuroshio. The <em>Sargassum</em> blooms were build-up in the middle of the ECS and pile-up in the coast of Korea from March to May. Recently, the <em>Sargassum</em> blooms were temporally expanded from to May from 2019 to 2022 and spatially raised in the YS and ECS. The initiated drifting blooms were detected in the Bohai Bay and Shandong Peninsula from September to October and then expanded in a southward direction from the central YS to Jeju Island, Korea during November to March. The blooms lasted 5-6 months in the YS and ECS. The second onset blooms were found near the mouth of the Yangtze River and Zhejiang Province from January to February and expanded in an east- or north-ward direction from March to May (or June). From the annual pattern maps of the golden tide blooms, we suggested two origins with tracing the temporal and spatial distribution and development. The first blooms were onset on fall around the Bohai Bay and/or Shandong Peninsula and southward controlled by the local wind and sea surface temperature condition on winter.

Since these algal blooms hamper the water production, strategies (e.g., injection of algaecide) have been looked at to prevent these from happening or try to control them. In this context, the HYperspectral Pointable System for Terrestrial and Aquatic Radiometry (HYPSTAR), installed since early 2021, helps in monitoring the effectiveness of these strategies. Indeed the HYPSTAR provides, at a very high temporal resolution, bio-optical parameters related to the water quality, i.e., Chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM). In addition, to catch the spatial variability of the water quality, we investigated the potential to provide more advanced water quality maps using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The optimized atmospheric correction method, ACOLITE-GLAD, taking into account adjacency effect and sunglint, was therefore used together with improved algorithms for water quality products, e.g., semi-empirical, semi-analytical, and, neural network based approaches.

Their monitoring is then one of the main duty of water quality managers. HAB monitoring is generally based on punctual water sampling and analysis which is time consuming. To support HAB monitoring, optical remote sensing as been used, providing information on total phytoplankton biomass with chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a). However, Chla is only partially informative as it does not allow to distinguish between phytoplankton species. Here, we show that the newly developed autonomous hyperspectral radiometry systems (PANTHYR and HYPSTAR) primary dedicated to the validation of water reflectance data from satellite can be very useful for HAB monitoring. On a first example, we show how <em>Phaeocystis globosa</em> bloom can be monitored with a PANTHYR system in the Southern North Sea. Although not toxic, this specie<em> </em>produces foam which accumulates on the beach impacting touristic and economical activities. On a second example, toxic cyanobacteria blooms are monitored in a water reservoir at Blankaart (Belgium). In both cases, HAB indexes are developed based on the specificity of pigment composition of the harmful phytoplankton species compared to other local species using the analysis of second derivatives of the water reflectance spectra. We hence show that HYPSTAR and PANTHYR technology associated with local HAB indexes will allow for an improvement of HAB monitoring with real time alerts at daily scale.",11,799,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

This presents a challenge, especially in inland waters, where the content of different optically active components, such as phytoplankton, organic matter, non-algal particles, increase the reflectance values in the NIR region compared to oceanic water. This hampers the application of usual AC algorithms, where water bodies are assumed to have reflectances values close to zero in the NIR region. In this work, four AC algorithms specially developed for application in water bodies (C2RCC, ACOLITE, Polymer and Level-2 OLCI product) were evaluated using the Sentinel-3-OLCI sensor (S3-OLCI) images, a multispectral radiometer specifically designed for use over water bodies. The reflectance spectra obtained from the processors were validated with in-situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data measured during field campaigns carried out in reservoirs and coastal water of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) with different trophic states, between 2018 and 2023. For this purpose, 27 images of S3-OLCI coinciding (±1 day) with dates of the field radiometry measurements, were atmospherically corrected using the four AC algorithms.

The resulting water reflectance spectra are proved to be of high quality (e.g., detailed saturations effects at short visible wavelengths, correlation with water turbidity). They allow assessing the performance of different atmospheric (and glint) correction algorithms applied to high (Sentinel2-MSI and Landsat8/9-OLI) and medium (Sentinel3-OLCI and MODIS) spatial resolution satellite data, based on numerous match-ups.

Estuarine waters presented the highest suspended loads (5.1 to 140.6 mg l<sup>-1</sup>) and T values (8.4 to 147.7 FNU).

Here, we describe the utility of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) in an AC framework, termed Aquaverse, for processing Landsat-8/-9 (L8/9) and Sentinel-2A/B (S2A/B) images over inland and nearshore coastal waters. First, a coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer (RT) model was adapted to simulate top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectra (rhot) for various imaging geometries and environmental conditions. Second, the hyperspectral pairs of rhot- Rrs spectra (@ 5 nm) were resampled with sensor spectral response functions and used subsequently to train MDNs to transform rhot to Rrs with the associated uncertainties. The trained model was applied to L8/9 and S2A/B imagery for an extensive matchup assessment obtained from AERONET-OC products (N ~ 800) and other field-measured datasets (N ~ 700). Compared to the state-of-the-art AC processors, our matchup analyses showed performance improvements from 20 to 100% depending on the spectral band and statistical metrics. Median estimated errors for L8/9 and S2A/B matchups combined were ~ 45%, 35%, 20%, and 30% for the 443, 482, 560, and 655 nm spectral bands, respectively.

Estimated above ground carbon biomass in the summer reached as high as 3.5 Gg carbon, declining to less than 0.3 Gg C in the winter, pointing towards a potential carbon export from the flats of ~3 Gg carbon per year.

The meter-scale spatial resolution and daily revisit frequency of the recent SuperDove constellation can potentially take the remote sensing of inland waters to the next level. However, there is a need to assess the radiometric quality of this new source of data for aquatic applications. This study examines the potential of SuperDove imagery in retrieving bathymetric and water constituent information in inland waters. We adopt both physics-based and machine-learning models to derive the biophysical parameters. The radiative transfer inversion model implemented in water color simulator (WASI) processor is parametrized to retrieve the concentration of chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter in Lake Trasimeno (Italy) using level-2 bottom-of-atmosphere SuperDove imagery. The flexibility of WASI in parametrization allowed us to effectively mitigate the atmospheric and sun-glint artifacts that are a severe problem.

Seawater SPM concentrations and characteristics (e.g., PSD, size class) based on the LISST-100x are examined in conjunction with optical measurements (beam attenuation coefficient, backscattering coefficient, particle spectral absorption coefficients and remote sensing reflectance) in two estuarine systems - Barataria Bay (particle-dominated) and Apalachicola Bay (DOM-dominated), located in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Surface SPM concentrations varied both spatially and temporally in both the bays, with higher concentrations in Barataria Bay (mean: 66.36 +/-&nbsp;29.17, 30.54 +/-&nbsp;8.20 and 21.62 +/- 12.81 mg/L) compared to Apalachicola Bay (7.65 +/-&nbsp;7.22, 8.05 +/-&nbsp;6.08 and 3.43 +/-&nbsp;1.73 mg/L) during spring, summer and fall, respectively.

Nitrogen fixing organisms, diazotrophs, provide a large amount of nitrogen for other organisms, particularly in large nutrient-depleted regions such as the subtropical gyres. However, how fine-scale structures with fast changing environmental conditions, in comparison with large ocean regions, impact the distribution and metabolic response of diazotrophs remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated diazotroph diversity and activity within the Gulf Stream and associated eddies; a region with intense eddy activity known for its significant role in nutrient transport into the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre.

They even influence biological processes in providing competitive advantages for the growth of some species by providing optimal temperature or nutrient concentration and composition. In this sense eddies can act as temporally existing and moving dynamical niches. To gain more insights into their dynamics, we carried out a case study of selected two dimensional eddies for the algal blooming season 2010 in the Western Baltic Sea. These findings are complemented by a multi-day case study of three-dimensional eddies in the Western Baltic Sea in summer 2018. Both studies are based on data from an eddy resolving biogeochemical ocean model. Eddies are detected as separated coherent water bodies that minimally mix with or leak into their neighbourhood. We found that eddies can trap nutrients favouring phytoplankton growth directly or prolong an existing bloom that is trapped by them from the very beginning. Even zooplankton was found to increase if sufficient phytoplankton was trapped, too. Contrarily, eddies can also thwart growth directly by transporting cold or nutrient depleted water or indirectly by impacting the thermocline or nutricline in their neighbourhood. Alternatively, they can just export nutrients or plankton from the coast to the open ocean. The gained knowledge of the case study in the Western Baltic Sea provides a first step towards a better understanding of eddy mediated transport processes of e.g. nutrients and eddies’ impact on plankton growth in the Baltic Sea.",1,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza B,

Toxic blooms pollute water, which sometimes is the main source of drinking water for surrounding areas. Toxic blooms also have negative effects on the ecological communities, including both aquatic and terrestrial populations. Most efforts have been focusing on predicting blooms, using statistical models and process-based models. Statistical models generally overlooks underlying ecological interactions, and only consider abiotic conditions, such as temperature, light intensity, nutrition concentration, and so on. Process-based models use mathematical expressions to describe explicit relationships among focal species and their surrounding environment, which is often highly complex with various parameters, many of which cannot be measured. Predictive models are useful in management decisions but do not help understand the origins of the blooms, which requires mechanistic models. A few models study algal bloom by forcing changes in environmental conditions while others suggest that bloom is an intrinsic property of complex communities. These models, despite being mechanistic, are often highly conceptual, and only describe the successional dynamics of the system without providing explicit ecological reasons of why a bloom occurs. Here, we explore the algal bloom phenomenon, combining both ecological mechanisms and data inference. A widespread property of a bloom is that it never contains one but often several cyanobacteria strains. Whether a bloom is toxic or not depends on the domination of the toxic or nontoxic strains, which can be investigated using niche overlap, fitness difference, and species robustness metrics of coexistence theory. Those metrics are derived from the intrinsic growth rates and the interactions strengths, which can be directly estimated from time series using a modified S-maps inference method. By following the evolution of coexistence metrics, we show how we can integrate biotic interactions to abiotic condition in studying the conditions leading to a bloom.",3,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza B,

Phytoplankton vary their composition in response to changing resource conditions, which can be described by the Droop model. The Droop model assumes that growth rate depends upon inter-cellular resources, adding one state variable per species to the Monod model to track the internal physiological state of the cell. The extra computational cost of the Droop model may be a notable weakness in a large-scale model. Motivated by fractional calculus analysis, we extend the Monod model to incorporate memory of past conditions, combining the best features of both the Monod and Droop model. Using statistical analysis and lab data, we show that our Monod-memory model estimates the growth rate, cell density, and resource concentration as well as the Droop model while requiring one less state variable. As an application, we show long-term simulations of competition among several taxa, illustrating the consequence of the memory elements on phytoplankton community dynamics.

These differences in bloom patterns are partly explained by the presence or absence of specific (a)biotic drivers and an interplay of bottom-up and top-down regulating factors. A change of driving environmental factors may interfere with the ability of phytoplankton communities to adapt to such changes and thus influence bloom patterns. Likewise, certain phytoplankton species can acclimatize fast to changing environmental drivers and self-stabilize their occurrence. The question is to what extent do environmental factors drive phytoplankton bloom patterns, and what is driven by species composition. Here, we used a data set of the southern Baltic Sea coast, including 31 monitoring stations, which constituted six different phytoplankton bloom types. Abiotic parameters had an impact on bloom patterns, whereas extreme weather events had an impact only on phytoplankton biomass but not necessarily on bloom patterns. Furthermore, a trained artificial network could describe seasonal changes in (a)biotic parameters, which were in part explained by the onset or presence of phytoplankton blooms. Thus, phytoplankton bloom patterns could drive seasonal patterns of nutrients, even after some extreme weather events.

Different reef substrates, including concrete oyster castles and biodegradable hardscapes, were constructed with various heights and widths adjacent to coastal&nbsp;marshes. Measurements were collected before and after reef construction to quantify changes to the wave, morphologic and ecologic environments related to reef presence and development. Oyster reefs were found to successfully dissipate wind-wave energy, but only under relatively shallow water depths (&lt;1 m below reef crest height). Reefs built adjacent to marsh edges showed a significant reduction in marsh edge erosion rates compared to exposed marsh edges, while reefs built further offshore showed no measurable difference in erosion along the top of the marsh, but a more gently sloping marsh edge. All artificial reef designs in this study successfully fostered larval recruitment and oyster growth, with significantly higher oyster densities recorded on higher elevation reefs, when constructed near mean water levels.&nbsp;",1,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

A REVIEW OF THE PERFORMANCE OF SUBTIDAL AND INTERTIDAL LIVING SHORELINE DESIGNS,"Living shoreline restoration efforts intend to regain the functionality of coastal ecosystems. However, restoration efforts are costly, and practitioners are often faced with the need to prioritize what resources to restore and corresponding restoration designs. Intertidal restoration designs are normally used when the priority is to protect shorelines from erosion, whereas subtidal designs are preferred when the emphasis is to enhance fisheries productivity. However, studies indicate intertidal designs may also enhance fisheries through the provision of habitat for juvenile recruits, and subtidal designs may also provide some erosion protection to adjacent shorelines. Here we carry out a comprehensive review to holistically assess the effectiveness of intertidal and subtidal living shoreline projects on ecosystem function restoration.&nbsp;&nbsp;We draw from our own studies in coastal Alabama (USA) and numerous other studies mined out from the literature. Intertidal designs often have positive effects on shoreline stabilization, and subtidal designs on fisheries productivity, although improvements do not always occur and, when they do, they can vary largely in magnitude. Furthermore, our analysis shows that, if well thought over, intertidal designs also have large positive impacts on fisheries productivity, and subtidal designs on shoreline stabilization. We conclude that, when well-planned, both intertidal and subtidal living shoreline restoration efforts can separately generate holistic improvement in coastal ecosystems.",3,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

Through a strategy referred to as “beneficial use” the sediments removed from these channels can be used locally to sustain coastal habitats that are threatened by sea level rise and erosion. As part of a larger effort to develop a framework for matching maintenance dredging projects with vulnerable coastal habitat, we designed a shoreline restoration project in coastal North Carolina, USA. The project uses sediments dredged from a nearby navigation channel to rebuild the historic footprint of an eroded shoreline marsh adjacent to the runway of a regional airport. The goal is to provide long-term protection against erosion and SLR to the runway. The potential benefits of this action were quantified with the Sea Level Affecting Marsh Model (SLAMM). The model was parameterized with site-specific data and run in multiple iterations under a range of future IPCC-defined sea level rise scenarios with and without the shoreline modification in place. Comparison among the modeled outputs allowed for evaluation of the impact of restoration on long term marsh persistence. Results indicate a substantial benefit of restoration in terms of persistence of the shoreline marsh through year 2050, under all SLR scenarios. After 2050, the benefits of the shoreline restoration are diminished, and differences among marsh area in the restored and unrestored condition decrease with increasing rates of SLR.",4,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

Recently, application of living shoreline has found sharpened purpose within the lexicon of coastal protection from climatic hazards, in the form of nature-based features. At the heart of nature-based flood and erosion defense strategies lies the goal of hydrodynamic attenuation- harnessing the energy-dissipating properties of biotic ‘ecosystem engineers’ to reduce incident wave and current energy near the shore. However, it is unclear to what extent flow attenuation should be expected or specified in living shoreline designs to achieve stability goals. In this work, results of field study within natural and restored or engineered biological canopies, including seagrasses, oyster reefs, and mangrove forests, are discussed with reference to nature-based design applications. Investigations of mean flow and turbulence above and within canopies of intertidal Eastern oyster (<em>Crassostrea virginica</em>) indicate that while both restored and natural reefs attenuate flows, levels of flow attenuation vary widely and rarely top 50% of the incident flow energy. Similarly, flow attenuation observed in reference-condition and restored mangrove and marsh grass shoreline vegetation are low while turbulence is enhanced. Patch heterogeneity in natural seagrass beds (<em>Halodule wrightii</em>) is observed to actually accelerate flows. Despite achieving relatively modest flow attenuations, natural and nature-based features consistently fulfill desired sediment transport functions, halting or reversing erosion. Though more complex, coupled flow-sediment transport relations should perhaps be the focus of nature-based feature designs to better align project goals with the dominant mechanisms for achieving them. &nbsp;",0,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

Sustainability of mangrove forest depends on successful propagule recruitment and seedling retention. For instance, young mangroves are vulnerable to dislodgement due to hydrodynamic forces and sediment erosion. Thus, restoring mangroves in the context of living shoreline could face the challenges to successful recruitment of young mangroves, a critical factor in the long-term sustainability of mangrove ecosystems. The present study aims to investigate how successful recruitment of young mangrove seedlings will lead to the development of healthy mangrove forest, thus creating opportunities to enhance coastal ecosystem. An experimental approach was attempted to investigate the dislodgement mechanisms on young red mangrove seedlings at different stages of seedling development subjected to flow and scour. One- and two-week-old seedlings showed strong vulnerability with seedling orientation; with instantaneous uprooting for seedlings oriented against the direction of flow. Most of the one-month-old seedlings were resistant to hydrodynamic forces and scour, and seedling failure occurred only due to large-scale bed erosion. It was found that there is rapid change in seedling survival rate during their early recruitment, where distinctive factors like underground biomass, seedling age, seedling orientation with the flow direction, hydrodynamic forces, and sediment transport dynamics have shown strong association with seedling success/failure.",2,,6/8/23 17:00,6/8/23 18:30,Sala Santa Catalina,

The presented study was performed for the first time in such a big scale for the Baltic Proper. The obtained seasonal temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentrations were consistent with previous observations.

Cable bacteria are long, filamentous, multicellular sulfide-oxidizing bacteria that transport electrons over centimeter distances in the sediment. They are found in diverse coastal sediments, and appear to act as “ecosystem engineers” in systems undergoing periods of hypoxia. Cable bacteria activity notoriously promotes the development of an Fe-firewall in sediments that helps prevent sulfide diffusion from the sediment to the overlying water during hypoxic periods. Therefore, cable bacteria activity also steers the biogeochemical development of seasonal hypoxia.&nbsp; However, the spatial and temporal distribution of cable bacteria in these dynamic ecosystems is not well constrained. In this study we performed field sampling and laboratory sediment incubations in two seasonal hypoxic sites, one carbonate-rich (the Netherlands) and one carbonate-poor site (Australia). Field sampling demonstrated the presence of an active cable bacteria population in both geographical locations, confirming that cable bacteria indeed thrive in seasonally hypoxic coastal systems. A seasonal trend was observed with higher abundance and activity of cable bacteria in spring compared to autumn. The sediment incubations served to follow the metabolic activity of cable bacteria over time (max 84 days), and confirmed the fast development of the electric network (cell doubling time: ~ 19 hours). During the exponential growth phase, cable bacteria acidified the sediment &gt;1.5 pH units in &lt;10 days and were responsible for &gt;70% of the oxygen uptake.

Spatial and seasonal variations in the ammonium flux from the sediment suggest a link between ammonium concentrations and riverine discharge. Higher ammonium flux from the sediment during late summer and fall, especially near the delta front of the South-West pass, is attributed to high respiration taking place in the sediment at low discharge. In turn, nitrification may not be significant in the summer and early fall, as a result of the low oxygen concentrations in bottom waters, suggesting that the sediment&nbsp;generates alkalinity either through denitrification, metal reduction, or sulfate reduction.

After more than two decades of environmental restoration efforts, most of these Mediterranean ecosystems showed an uneven recovery dynamic with respect to eutrophication, water chemical quality and are still impacted by seasonal or permanent deoxygenation. These observations are often attributed to the sediment that is acting as a source of legacy nutrients and pollutants, especially during oxygen depletion events, which can sustain eutrophication and water quality degradation. Depending on their eutrophication status, benthic habitats of Mediterranean lagoons can evolve from bare non-vegetated sediment to ecosystems dominated by opportunistic macroalgae, seagrass beds and perennial macroalgae. Their presence and resilience to deoxygenation events are expected to alter theoretical biogeochemical cycles, which are currently poorly studied. In a context of increasing deoxygenation favored by climate change, they are suspected to play an emerging and increasing role in the release of nutrients and pollutants from sediments that could delay the restoration of lagoon ecosystems. Four typical benthic habitats representing contrasted eutrophication status in Mediterranean lagoons (bare sediment, sediment with <em>Chaetomorpha sp</em>., sediment with <em>Halopythis sp</em>., and sediment with <em>Zostera noltei</em>) were exposed to long-term confinement using benthic chambers. Biogeochemical responses of these habitats were monitored for O<sub>2</sub> demand, nutrients (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>), indicators of early diagenesis processes (Mn, Fe, sulfides) and trace elements, using water samples and sediment cores analysis. Benthic fluxes of oxygen and nutrients were the highest in habitats with <em>Chaetomorpha sp</em>. and <em>Halopythis sp</em>., macrophytes representing early stages in the recovery trajectory. When the oxygen demand exceeded its production, anoxia occurred within 1-2 days. This led to higher nutrient remobilization, their concentration in the water column then exceeded the threshold of ""Bad"" eutrophication status within a few days. Metal-oxide reduction in the surface sediment occurred under hypoxic conditions while sulfate reduction occurred under anoxic conditions. Significant releases of As, Sb, and Co were also observed under conditions of strong reduction and low pH in the presence of sulfides whereas precipitation and co-precipitation of sulfide with Fe, Co and Mo occurred under anoxic conditions.

H<sub>2</sub>S is thought to mainly originate from the sediment and is generally contained within the anoxic water mass by microbial sulfide oxidation processes at the oxic-anoxic interface. While oxygen is an important oxidant here, recent studies point to the additional involvement of nitrate and nitrite. Aiming at a deeper understanding of pathways, interactions, and controls, we studied nitrogen and sulfur cycling in the seasonally anoxic Mariager Fjord, Denmark.

The study of respiratory kinetics provides insight into the adaptation of the microbial community to decreasing levels of O2. Prokaryotes can use different types of terminal oxidases with a broad range of affinities for O2 during aerobic respiration thus modulating their affinity for O2.

Maximum respiration rates ranged from 254 to 355 nM O2/h, being dependent of the temperature (from 14 to 17 deg). The half saturation constant (Km) decreased from values of 139 nM in oxic waters to 76 nM in the hypoxic layer, suggesting a dominant contribution of low affinity terminal oxidases in fully oxic waters and the adaptation of the community in low O2 waters with increasing use of high affinity terminal oxidases.

In Lake Superior sediments, nitrate production depends on the proximity to shore but could account for nearly 50% of the annual accumulation of nitrate in the water column. To date little is known of the microorganisms that drive the cycling of nitrogen in these sediments. Here we assess the potential and active transformation of nitrogen species by individual organisms, through metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, in order to reconstruct hypothetical nitrogen cycling networks. We uncovered novel organizational structures for nitrogen recycling across both spatial and biochemical gradients. We find that regardless of oxygen penetration, there's potential for nitrate reduction and that taxonomic diversity for nitrate reducers doesn’t correlate with oxygen concentration (e.g., sites with deeper penetration have greater diversity).

Rates of gross primary production (P) for these benthic functional types (BFTs) are remarkably consistent across biogeographical regions, supporting the idea that reefs exhibit modal metabolism. Variability in measured rates is likely arising from differences in light availability. In fact, P is a linear function of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the fraction of PAR absorbed by the plants (fPAR), and light-use efficiency (LUE), which parameterizes the plants' biochemical capacity for CO2 fixation: P = PAR * fPAR * LUE. On time scales of days to weeks, fPAR and LUE are far more stable than PAR. LUE is a critical parameter: It is the productive response integrated across all environmental conditions, other than light. If BFTs exhibit consistent P across wide geographic ranges, then their LUEs must also be consistent. The aim of this study was to estimate LUEs for algae, coral, and sand. Using data collected during NASA's CORAL mission in 2016-2017, LUE was calculated for 32 mixed communities at Lizard Island, GBR (10); Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii (8); Guam (6); and Palau (8).

Most notably, we quantified a near doubling of photoprotective carotenoids in the algal community since 1995, coincident with a shoaling of surface ocean mixed layer depths and a boost in algal biomass and productivity. Our time series shows a persistent shallowing of the upper mixed layer that is accompanied by widespread photoacclimation of the resident phytoplankton communities towards a more high-light adapted state.

Superoxide decayed more rapidly during irradiation when compared to superoxide decay in the dark, suggesting the presence of a light-dependent sink.

When in excess, these nutrients may impact community structure and increase harmful algal blooms (HABS) that produce toxins or consume dissolved oxygen during biomass decay. Here, we present dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients and carbon as well as short and long-lived radium isotopes measured over a seasonal cycle across multiple years in Langebaan Lagoon. This ecosystem is located north of Cape Town, South Africa, and is part of the West Coast National Park Marine Protected Area. Over the past century, the region has experienced a significant increase in the frequency of HABs as well as an expansion in oxygen minimum zones in offshore waters that resulted in mass strandings of tons of rock lobster and crayfish. Our results indicate the Lagoon is well mixed and flushed within a day. Nutrient data suggests significant inorganic phosphorus is released into Lagoon surface waters from groundwater/sediments, derived from extensive phosphate-bearing minerals along the margin and inland of Langebaan Lagoon (e.g., Elandsfontein Phosphate Mine). In contrast, extremely high dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations, often the most abundant form of N, are associated with low radium activities and argue for an anthropogenic source, perhaps associated with development within and around nearby Saldanha Bay. Current efforts are underway to examine nitrogen isotope signatures of DON and total dissolved nitrogen to elucidate differences in nutrient sources to the Langebaan Lagoon ecosystem.",1,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Menorca B,

Within SC, fecal coliform is the only water quality pathogen with mandated shellfish closure limits. Over the past decade, increases in fecal coliform bacteria have resulted in numerous shellfish closures along the coast. Here we examine linkages between land use/cover and fecal coliform concentrations in stormwater runoff from 9 discrete drainage basins within Murrells Inlet, SC. The drainages span a range of land cover and environmental characteristics, including land use and soil type, degree of impervious surface, flow path length, stormwater infrastructure, and drainage topography. It is hypothesized that more urbanized regions with a higher percentage of impervious surfaces, lead to a higher concentration and flux of coliform via stormwater runoff. Using Arc GIS&nbsp;and NOAA C-CAP land cover data was used to quantify the type and changes in land use over the past 20 years to show the magnitude of urbanization in Murrells Inlet. We use USA SURGO to assess runoff and infiltration potential of different soil types. Drainage basin land use types generally range from medium density to medium high-density urbanization with an average percent impervious coverage of 53.2%. Urbanization has increased impervious surface coverage by ~ 11.0%.

Existing methods of characterizing respiration rely either on the use of model simulation or ex situ synoptic measurements (e.g., bottle incubations).&nbsp; Neither approach can resolve temporal patterns in respiration and its covariance with potential drivers. &nbsp;To provide better data, we developed and deployed autonomous respiration chambers (ARCs) in a temperate estuary that experiences chronic seasonal hypoxia, Long Island Sound, USA (LIS). The ARCs were deployed continuously for two- to four-week intervals at multiple depths between June and October in 2020 and 2021.

In 2021, a year with high rainfall, respiration was inversely correlated with salinity suggesting greater precipitation and urban runoff could increase respiration in LIS. In the two seasons, the ARCs collected more respiration rates than were made in the preceding 15 years and are now being used to quantify contributions of hypoxia to acidification in LIS bottom water.",4,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Menorca B,

Climate change threatens to increase erosion over time as sea levels rise and the frequency and intensity of storms increase. In Boston, sea levels are predicted to rise up to 0.5m by mid-century, and up to 2.1m by 2100 (NOAA, 2022). These changes lead to more exposure to waves, storm surge, and ultimately more erosion and flooding. Understanding the dynamics of coastal erosion is essential to guiding the design of coastal shoreline protections, the research of which is one of the goals of the Stone Living Laboratory. However, the episodic nature of storms makes associated erosion events difficult to quantify and distinguish from more incremental erosion caused by seasonal wind and rain and annual freezing and thawing cycles. To improve monitoring of the impact of episodic severe storms on the coastal bluffs and shores of Rainsford Island, the northeast bluff was scanned four times with a high-resolution terrestrial LiDAR (the commercial Riegl VZ400i instrument) over 14 months from July 22, 2021 to October 19, 2022, including before and after the region experienced two hurricanes, Henri and Ida, in late August 2021. In this study we were able to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the locations and magnitude of erosion along the Rainsford bluff that occurred after two major storm events (short-term) and an annual seasonal cycle (long-term).

Commuting and leisure travel reductions in coastal urban areas, such as New York City (NYC), still persist. NYC was particularly hard-hit by the pandemic such that by May 2020, declines in fossil fuel consumption and nitrogen (N)-rich emissions improved air quality. The adjacent Long Island Sound (LIS) estuary receives extensive N inputs from wastewater, atmospheric deposition and other sources leading to seasonal hypoxia and algal blooms. We assessed whether these novel human behavioral changes were associated with shifts in LIS phytoplankton and microbial assemblages as well as other water quality indicators, emphasizing the NYC-Connecticut commuting corridor. To quantify these processes, physical water quality, biogeochemical (chlorophyll-a, nutrients), ecological (phytoplankton, bacteria), genomic (16S, 18S), and bio-optical (FDOM, CDOM, reflectance) measurements were evaluated monthly, and phytoplankton responses to N were assessed. These entailed leveraged long-term water quality monitoring, small boat surveys, and shore sampling/experimentation.

Terrestrial dissolved organic matter (terrDOM) is typically comprised of larger humic molecules with stronger amphipathic properties compared to phytoplankton-derived marine DOM (marDOM) and thus has a more favourable adsorption profile for lipophilic contaminants. Previous studies show that some contaminants adsorb well to terrDOM, leading to reduced bioconcentration (direct uptake from water) at the base of aquatic food webs. However, the very same properties may lead to an increased contaminant uptake via feeding processes in filter feeding organisms under terrDOM exposure. To test whether the presence of terrDOM leads to higher contaminant uptake then marDOM, we exposed blue mussels (<em>Mytilus edulis</em>) and, in a second experiment, ascidians (<em>Ciona intestinalis</em>) to teflubenzuron - a lipophilic (log K<sub>OW</sub>: 5.39) veterinary drug commonly used in aquaculture against sea lice - under four different DOM conditions: terrDOM, marDOM, mixDOM (a mixture of terrDOM and marDOM) and seawater only. Each of the two experiments used a factorial design including the four DOM conditions and teflubenzuron exposure (exposure, control), with triplicate aquaria for each treatment (n= 24 aquaria). Contrary to expectations, our results showed that terrDOM exposure did not lead the highest bioaccumulation for either of the two taxa, but we rather observed higher bioaccumulation for the marDOM or mixDOM exposure. However, terrDOM exposure also did not lead to lower bioaccumulation than the seawater only treatment. Bioaccumulation of teflubenzuron was overall higher in blue mussels than ascidians. We conclude that the overall small difference in accumulation rates observed in both taxa is likely not environmentally relevant and the effect of terrDOM alone as a vector for teflubenzuron under comparable conditions is likely negligible.",5,841,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Sediment Hg-methylating microbial communities included putative sulfate reducers, methanogens and fermenters. N and C isotopic signatures of invertebrates indicated that there was a change in community structure in these impoundments and fish growth of some species slowed down at these locations. Subcellular fractionation of northern pike livers indicated that older fish from these impoundments had higher levels of biomarkers of lipid peroxidation associated with higher MeHg levels in their mitochondrial fraction.&nbsp;Carbon isotope signatures of CO2 were linked to MeHg accumulation at the base of the food chain whereas both carbon processing and trophic level explained accumulation higher in the food chain.

About 40 billion cubic meters (representing a value of 30 billion EUR) have been found (e.g. Boehrer et al. 2019). The industrial exploitation has recently started. The deposit represents an important access to fossil energy for both adjacent countries, especially for Rwanda, which otherwise does not have access to fossil energy on its territory. However the enormous gas pressures have been feared to result in sudden large scale ebullition events “limnic eruptions” which would threaten the lives of about two million local inhabitants. For planning economic exploitation and for ensuring safe conditions during operation of gas plants the hydrology of the Lake needs to be understood. For this purpose, also noble gases have been measured, in the hope these noble gases could indicate whether the lake had experienced large scale degassing events in recent history (i.e ~1000 years i.e. the age of the oldest water contained in the lake). Indeed, measurements showed that noble gases were depleted: neon by about 50% while argon and krypton were depleted by about 70% compared to atmospheric equilibrium at given conditions (Bärenbold et al. 2021). However the fact that neon was depleted the least indicated this was not (only) the result of degassing events. In the presented study, we tested to which extent the observed depletion of noble gases could be explained by high formation temperatures of the inflowing groundwater. For this purpose, noble gas solubilities had to be accurately be determined to higher temperatures (up to 80°C from existing data starting from 0°C, Schwenk et al. 2022a). From these data, (1) the temperature of saturation could be deduced. As a consequence of the differing temperature behaviours between noble gases, (2) ratios of noble gas concentrations could directly be linked to formation temperatures. Finally, (3) simultaneous least square fitting of formation temperatures and excess air with the special software packet PANGA, allowed conclusions about formation temperatures and missing gas portion (Schwenk et al. 2022b). All three approaches consistently indicated a formation temperature of Lake Kivu deep water at 65°C. At this temperature, all interpreted noble gases are close to saturation indicating that the presently contained water in Lake Kivu has not experienced a large scale ebullition. It is concluded, that the deep water of Lake Kivu is most probably formed on the northern slopes, which are of volcanic origin and so porous that no surface drainage of precipitation happens. Precipitation hence percolates through the aerated soil and meets the groundwater table at a temperature of about 65C.

Overall, the results of these models are satisfactory, and each of them can find an application in the management of a nuclear accident affecting the marine environment. Thus, it can be noted that the biokinetic models are particularly suitable for the accidental phase, i.e. the acute phase of the accident which is mainly dealt with in the crisis centers, although they can also be used in the post-accidental phase.

This especially applies to the field-specific application of pesticides which are considered to be mainly transported into aquatic systems by surface runoff and local-scale wind drift. However, there is evidence of many pesticides with ubiquitous occurrences in different aquatic settings, questioning current theories on their transport and fate. This study from North-eastern Germany presents monitoring results of pesticides in agricultural ponds and adjacent shallow groundwater. The results show that individual substances do not only occur simultaneously in both, surface water and groundwater but also follow similar concentration dynamics. This does not only apply to single locations but also to different locations with different land use intensities. Pesticides found comprise substances currently in use, metabolites and legacy compounds. Since for many of the detected substances concentrations are higher in surface water, groundwater exfiltration can be excluded as an advective source for pond pollution. The findings rather demonstrate a similar ubiquitous state of pollution in both, surface and subsurface aquatic environments whose dynamics are driven by a common factor. We suspect the substances are trapped in aquatic systems underlying delayed removal. Furthermore, regional subsurface hydrology may be responsible for temporal occurrences and concentration dynamics of individual substances.",5,,6/5/23 15:00,6/5/23 16:30,Sala Ibiza A,

Minimal change in grain size, organic and phosphorus concentration, and mineral fluorapatite percentage were documented, suggesting little significant change in natural sediment sources and composition. Short-lived radioisotopes were elevated and may be attributed to either the discharge, groundwater input, or the sediments. Phosphorus detected may be of from the fluorapatite detected with little influence from the emergency discharge.

While recent research has demonstrated the degree of alteration of the forms of phosphorus (P) through a SWM pond during growing season months, very little is known about SWM pond reactivity during colder months, and nitrogen (N) dynamics remain largely unstudied. Thus, the role of the SWM pond on aqueous N:P ratios to receiving ecosystems is presently unknowable, preventing assessment of these engineered structures as control points in the urban stream corridor. We present detailed accounting of N and P speciation through a SWM pond over a 16-month continuous period. There were significant decreases in reactive forms of N (nitrate) and P (phosphate); however, total N and P patterns diverged, with a 3-fold decrease in TN but a 50 % increase in TP concentrations. Upwards of 80 % of the N load coming into the pond was nitrate, while the outflow contained a mix of particulate N, nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved organic N. In contrast, P in waters entering the pond existed in various forms of PP, DOP, and phosphate, but exited almost exclusively as PP. Overall, there was a 7-fold drop in total N:P from 41:1 to 6:1, and a 3-fold decrease in reactive N:P from 130:1 to 43:1.

To protect from the detrimental effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), visitors are prone to use sunscreens, which inevitably end up released into the environment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of two of the most common organic UV filters, oxybenzone and octocrylene, on natural microbial communities of Fildes Bay (King George Island), regarding changes in their community composition, cell abundance, photosynthetic efficiency (Ω), metabolism, as well as the nutrients availability to them. Overall, oxybenzone had a greater impact than octocrylene, with a mean inhibitory concentration on the whole phytoplankton community of 5.9 and 4.0 mg L-1 in the absence or presence of UVR, respectively, being &gt;50 mg L-1 in the case of octocrylene. However, the smallest microorganisms were already affected by both sunscreens at 0.5 mg L-1, especially in the presence of UVR. Nutrients availability increased as the concentrations of both chemicals augmented, above all with oxybenzone and UVR. Both UV filters reduced both primary production, in the case of oxybenzone reducing Ω by a 30%; and respiration, more pronounced with oxybenzone in the absence of UVR and octocrylene on its presence. Although these results point to a higher toxicity of oxybenzone than octocrylene, both UV filters should be considered for regulation according to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.",1,,6/5/23 17:00,6/5/23 18:30,Sala Ibiza A,

To test this hypothesis, water samples were taken from 9 locations in the Cuyahoga River watershed in northern Ohio, USA. This watershed covers areas of forest, agricultural and urban/developed land use types with varying local population sizes. Concentrations of PPCP compounds of four major usage classes, i.e., caffeine (stimulants), acetaminophen (painkillers), sulfamethoxazole (human antibiotics), and sulfanilamide (female antibacterial products), were measured using LC-MS. Land use type and population size were obtained from USGS and US census data. Our results showed that PPCP concentrations in sampled streams ranged between several to hundreds of ng/L and varied significantly among sampling sites and time. Sulfamethoxazole concentrations were significantly correlated with human population size, while concentrations of caffeine, sulfanilamide, and acetaminophen were not significantly influenced by human populations.

Here we quantified the magnitude of Pb, Zn and Cd emissions sequestered by <em>Posidonia australis</em> meadows since 1889. The metal pollution record contained within seagrass soil cores sampled across the region showed that smelting operations contaminated the entire area, with decreasing metal sequestration by seagrass with increasing distance from discrete points of contamination.

The ability of PAEs to leach from plastic products facilitate their omnipresence in aquatic ecosystems, and thus can seriously threaten these environments. Distribution and degradation of PAEs in aquatic systems are partly driven by suspended matter (SPM). In this study, three different levels of SPM concentration and 4 PAEs (Diethyl phthalate [DEP], Di-iso-butyl phthalate [DiBP], Dibutyl phthalate [DBP], and Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalates [DEHP]) were chosen to investigate the impact of SPM on the PAEs behaviour in lagoon water column over 9 days experiment. The results revealed different behaviour of PAEs in water column, which primarily depend on their molecular weight. Higher molecular weight PAE (HMW), such as DEHP, was mainly bound to suspended particles compared to lower molecular weight PAEs (LMW; DEP, DBP, DiBP), which were preferentially found in the dissolved phase. However, changing SPM concentration in the water column altered the removal kinetics (biodegradation + evaporation) of all targeted PAEs. Lower molecular weight PAEs, especially DEP, were the most impacted by the water column changes, while on opposite, the DEHP was least affected. Consequently, SPM may play a different role in water quality and determine the fate of PAEs in the environment, influencing their transport (mostly of HMW), accumulation in sediment (sedimentation and burial) or degradation (especially for LMW).",8,837,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

A stable isotope mass balance shows on average 56% of tDOC is remineralized upstream of our site, while 77% of CDOM is bleached.

CDOM spectral slope properties, such as S<sub>275–295</sub>, are highly sensitive at low but not at high tDOC concentrations. Other properties are linearly related to tDOC, and we find that specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA<sub>254</sub>) and DOC-normalized fluorescence intensity are the best tracers over a wider tDOC concentration range. However, the optical properties did not correlate with the extent of tDOC remineralization.

Chromatography is the most efficient method for characterizing the chemical composition of complex mixtures. However, the molecular composition of DOM is so complex that it is difficult to achieve the separation of monomeric compounds in DOM with even the most efficient chromatography. Currently, the molecular composition of DOM can only be obtained through ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry.

We tested organic matter from three different inland water systems (a humic stream, a clearwater lake and a hypereutrophic lake), and found a strong negative relationship between hydrophobicity and reactivity, consistent for the three systems. Freshwater DOM therefore becomes more hydrophobic as it is biologically degraded. Additionally, we found that the most hydrophilic fraction was poorly recovered by solid phase extraction (SPE) (3-28% DOC recovery) and was thus selectively missed by mass spectrometry analysis due to SPE preparation. The change in DOM composition after incubation was very low according to SPE-ESI (electrospray ionization)-mass spectrometry (14% change, while replicates had 11% change), revealing that this method is sub-optimal to assess DOM reactivity, regardless of fraction hydrophobicity. Our results demonstrate that SPE-ESI mass spectrometry method does not detect the most hydrophilic and most reactive species. Hence, they question our current understanding on the relationships between DOM reactivity and its molecular composition, which is built on the use of this method.",5,846,6/6/23 18:30,6/6/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

We hypothesized that marine, terrestrial and porewater-influenced DOM contains source-specific molecular fingerprints. We detected thousands of molecular formulas and various structural features. The increasing relative abundance of aliphatic structures from the river to the coastal ocean reflects the increasing influence of marine, microbial DOM, whereas the decreasing relative abundance of terrestrial aromatic structural motifs suggests estuarine dilution and/or removal of these compound groups by processes such as flocculation and photochemical degradation. Aromatic structural motifs were underestimated by a factor of three by <sup>1</sup>H-detecting NMR experiments compared to FT-ICR-MS analysis.

Although DOM in sediments is commonly assumed to be recalcitrant a few recent studies suggested that sediment pore waters may serve as a source of bioavailable DOM to the overlying water column, which may stimulate microbial activity in the near-bottom waters. In this study, we combine the measurements of DOC and DOM optical properties, such as chromophoric (CDOM) and fluorescent (FDOM) DOM, with size exclusion chromatography to trace bioavailability and diagenetic changes of DOM in and above the sediment pore waters and to evaluate the diffusive and net DOM release to the overlying bottom water in three southern Baltic Sea Deeps: Bornholm, Gdansk, and Gotland, affected by sub- and anoxia. We found strong spatial differences in DOM efflux to the water column, as well as in optical properties accumulation with sediment depth among the three deeps, caused by different diagenetic stages of the organic matter in the Deeps. Interestingly, the molecular weight of DOM was not altered significantly with sediment depth (i.e. during later diagenetic stages) and among the three Deeps. Our results suggest that DOM is likely to undergo structural recombination rather than molecular decomposition during aging in sediments.

These systems are also influenced by tides and other physical processes that make them hydrodynamically complex. In these dynamic biogeochemical hotspots, the DOM is typically made up of a very diverse and heterogeneous mixture of compounds with varying reactivities that regulate the extent to which DOM is transformed in the estuary and exported to the adjacent coastal ocean. Predicting the photochemical and biological reactivity of DOM based on its source and degradation state in these complex systems is therefore crucial to understand the fate of organic matter moving across the land-ocean continuum and to accurately estimate carbon export to the coastal ocean.

The combined method allowed quantification of SPE-DOM, and allowed investigation of total, ionisable, and chromophoric SPE-DOM fractions, which varied independently from each other in time and across the samples. Most interestingly, the abundance of chromophoric DOM (per unit of carbon) increased as total [DOC] increased, while ionisable DOM per unit carbon was relatively stable. In other words, total DOC concentration was mostly dictated by coloured DOM, and by extension coloured DOM is likely more reactive than ionisable DOM. Secondly, ionisable DOM increased per unit carbon in the summer compared to winter, across all sites, likely due to autotrophic production. Coloured DOM did not change seasonally.

The method uses reversed-phase chromatography in combination with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LC-FT-ICR MS). It allows effective salt separation and highly sensitive detection of organic compounds in as little as 100 µL of seawater.

The relative activation of the two trophic strategies depends on environmental conditions, such as light intensity, inorganic nutrient concentrations, and prey availability. However, observed dependencies so far challenge simple models. Here we integrate field observations and a trait-based model to explore possible rules underlying the variable degree of photosynthesis and phagotrophy performed by MTD. The observations reveal a dominant role of prey availability for trophic regulation, while inorganic nutrient concentration and light intensity played only a secondary role. Surprisingly, increasing prey availability did not always correspond to more phagotrophy in MTD. At low prey concentrations, increasing prey availability stimulates higher photosynthetic resource allocation. Phagotrophy thus operates as an alternative nutrient source that promotes a higher energetic yield of photosynthesis, which surpasses the one achieved by phagotrophy alone. This pattern can be explained by our trait- and optimality-based model, where MTD are assumed to regulate the proportion of photosynthesis versus phagotrophy to maximize their growth rate. Our optimality theory may thus improve the yet limited capability to predict periods of MTD dominance, which frequently appear as harmful algae blooms.",5,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Sala Portixol 2,

Although mixotrophy in natural populations of small phytoplanktonic communities (nano- and picophytoplankton) has been documented in several oceanic regions, the ecological extent of mixotrophy in oligotrophic ecosystems (open ocean and coastal) remains unknown. Here, we presented results from two very contrasted coastal ecosystems: one temperate influenced by seasonal upwelling dynamics (Rias Baixas, Spain) and one tropical subject to oligotrophic conditions (French Guiana, northeastern South America).

For both oligotrophic coastal ecosystems, the carbon uptake from bacterivory <em>versus</em> the carbon uptake from phototrophy showed great variation along the water column but also spatially. The importance of bacterivory did not seem to be linked to a specific environmental parameter such as nutrient concentration or light.

Phototrophs dominated the biomass and heterotrophs showed similar bacterial ingestion rates across all simulated run-off scenarios. Mixotrophs, however, showed higher bacterial ingestion rates after the extreme pulse event compared to the other treatments.

Given their apparent importance in the contemporary ocean, it is relevant to assess how the presence of mixotrophy might impact the predicted ocean biogeochemical response to climate change. Here we show that mixotrophs may enhance the response to climate change that is seen in models based on a strict dichotomy between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Predicted decreases in average plankton size and carbon export at low latitudes - and corresponding increases at high latitudes - are both exaggerated by the presence of mixotrophy. Further simulations exploring the sensitivity of these findings to unknown potential trade-offs between mixotrophic and specialist strategies revealed that the strength of these responses decreased when greater costs were associated with mixotrophy.

Leveraging high frequency <em>in situ </em>imaging, we investigated the fine-scale distribution and<em> </em>orientation of ~230,000 organisms belonging to three groups of Rhizaria, including the mixotrophic taxa Acantharia and Collodaria, and the non-mixotrophic Phaeodaria. We brought to light differences in vertical distribution between subgroups, likely revealing different life strategies and contrasted abilities for buoyancy control. We also detected a previously undocumented preferential orientation of some organisms in each taxon. Finally, we infer from some of our observations presumptive steps of the obscure life cycle of Collodaria, which seems to involve fine buoyancy control to reach new environments and enable <em>de novo</em> symbiont acquisition. Altogether, these unprecedented results highlight that complex ecological behaviour can be achieved by “simple” unicellular organisms. ",1,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Sala Portixol 2,

They comprise constitutive mixotrophs (CMs) that have an innate photosynthetic ability and non-constitutive mixotrophs (NCMs) that acquire it from their prey. We modelled phototrophy and phagotrophy of two mixotrophic protists as a function of irradiance and prey abundance. We hypothesised that differences in their physiology (constitutive versus non-constitutive mixotrophy) can result in different responses to light gradients. We fitted the models with primary production and bacterivory data from laboratory and field experiments with the nanoflagellate <em>Chrysochromulina parva</em> (CM) and the ciliate <em>Ophrydium naumanni</em> (NCM) from north Andean Patagonian lakes. We found a non-monotonic response of phototrophy and phagotrophy to irradiance in both mixotrophs, which was successfully represented by our models. Maximum values for phototrophy and phagotrophy were found at intermediate irradiance coinciding with the light at the deep chlorophyll maxima in these lakes. At lower and higher irradiances, we found a decoupling between phototrophy and phagotrophy in the NCM while these functions were more coupled in the CM. Our modelling approach revealed the difference between both mixotrophic functional types on the balance between their nutritional strategies under different light scenarios. Thus, our proposed models can be applied to account how changing environmental conditions affect both primary and secondary production within the planktonic microbial food web.",2,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 2,

For example nutrients contained in prey can directly fuel primary production by mixotrophic predators, and feeding rates by mixotrophs can be regulated by the availability of light. Here we present a range of approaches exploring the impact of light on mixotrophic protists. Laboratory experiments show that closely related mixotrophic chrysophytes show contrasting responses to light intensity with some increasing and others decreasing their ingestion rates at higher light intensities. Similar variability is found among co-occurring mixotrophs in a natural community of an oligotrophic lake. A meta-analysis of laboratory experiments performed with cultured mixotrophs suggests that feeding rates most commonly increase with increasing light intensity, yet the same analysis also reveals biases in experimental choices with overrepresentation of dinoflagellates. To further resolve how altered rates of&nbsp; feeding and photosynthesis will translate into population trajectories of different mixotrophic taxa within the context of their natural communities, we performed mesocosm experiments manipulating light availability in the sub-alpine Lake Lunz. Preliminary analyses show decreased abundances of mixotrophic taxa under low light availability, but the full analysis of community dynamics based on 18S rDNA amplicon profiling still needs to reveal if this is accompanied by an increasing importance of heterotrophic taxa.",1,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 2,

As a result of their flexible metabolic strategies, mixotrophs are important regulators of global biogeochemical cycles. Constitutive marine mixotrophs have been empirically shown to respond to warming by reducing photosynthesis and increasing grazing rates and, in some cases, demonstrate evidence for adaptive evolution that compounds these short-term responses. However, little is known about how mixotroph adaptation (and simultaneous changes in stoichiometry and nutritional content) will scale to alter other trophic levels in marine planktonic food webs. Here, we assess the numerical and functional responses of natural dinoflagellate predators to various concentrations of evolved marine mixotrophs from a multi-year climate change evolution experiment. Our results show that dinoflagellate predators experienced altered growth rates and grazing rates when fed different strains of experimentally evolved mixotrophs. Specifically, predators experienced lower grazing and growth rates when fed mixotrophs with evidence of adaptive evolution to warm temperatures. Overall, we show that climate-change driven evolutionary responses from mixotrophs can alter their palatability and nutritional value, thus impacting populations of their natural predators. Our work provides new insights into understanding the dynamics of microbial food webs in the face of climate change.",3,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 2,

Because mixotrophs can act as primary producers or consumers, they have a complex role in marine food webs. As mixotrophs adjust their metabolic strategy by photoacclimation and attack rate modification, their ecological role may also change over time. However, little is known about how the metabolic strategy of mixotrophs complicates their functional role in larger food webs. Here, we asked how resource availability affects a mixotrophic cell’s preferred metabolic strategy. We tested how light and food availability impacted the growth rates, carbon acquisition rates, and metabolic investment strategies of eight strains of the mixotrophic chrysophyte, <em>Ochromonas</em>. All eight <em>Ochromonas</em> strains photoacclimated by decreasing chlorophyll content as light intensity increased. Some strains are obligate phototrophs that require light for growth, while other strains showed stronger metabolic responses to prey availability. When prey availability was high, all eight strains exhibited accelerated growth rates and decreased their investment in both photosynthesis and phagotrophy. Photosynthesis and phagotrophy generally produced additive benefits. With the addition of abundant bacterial prey, Ochromonas growth rates were elevated above the maximum, light-saturated rates of growth at lower bacterial abundances. The additive benefits observed between photosynthesis and phagotrophy in Ochromonas suggest that the two metabolic modes provide non-substitutable resources, which may explain why a tradeoff between phagotrophic and phototrophic investments emerged in some but not all strains.",2,853,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In this research we employ a numerical plankton model that reproduces seasonal succession dynamics to investigate how mixotrophic abilities and enrichment influence population dynamics. Results demonstrate that enrichment can generate chaos amongst yearly peak mixotroph densities. In some cases, the year-to-year peak mixotroph densities became erratic and highly variable. Further, we demonstrate that chaotic dynamics arise in the model system under a wide range of mixotroph life-history trait combinations. These results demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that initiation of a mixotrophic HAB can occur with enrichment, due to erratic population spikes, when no role of broadcast allelopathy is considered. Had allelopathy been included as part of the model, it is likely that once the mixotroph population reached a threshold at which allelochemicals produce mass effects, the persisting algae populations would have been eliminated and the mixotroph bloom trajectory reinforced, reaching even higher population densities. These results help unify understandings of broadcast allelopathy in algal bloom formation. They may also shed light on why it is difficult to predict the occurrence of mixotrophic HABs based solely on environmental variables, when the year-to-year maximum density of the mixotroph is chaotic with enrichment.",0,,6/6/23 15:00,6/6/23 16:30,Sala Portixol 2,

Changing weather patterns may increase UV intensities in some habitats, making zooplankton more susceptible to DNA damage and lifespan reduction. Pigmented species found in high UVR environments are hypothesized to demonstrate increased resistance to environmentally relevant levels of UV. Highly pigmented (HP) bdelloid rotifers found in rock pools in El Paso Co., TX were collected after rainfall events, with a portion cultured until they were non-pigmented (NP). Three approaches were used to evaluate responses of bdelloids to UV: 1) Exposure to 3-UV intensities (winter mean, summer mean, and extreme scenario) for 2 h; recovery was assessed after 48 h., 2) Effects of maternal (F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) UV exposure on offspring (F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and 3) Differentially expressed gene (DEG) responses of exposed bdelloids were measured by RNAseq. Pigmented rotifers demonstrated 4X greater resistance to UV than NP treatments, although survival decreased as UV intensity increased. Lifespan increased by 117% and net reproductive rate by 233% for bdelloids in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;low UV treatment as compared to the control. 30% of HP transcripts were also expressed in NP, of which 73% were DEGs.

The impact of warming on zooplankton depends not only on physiological sensitivity, but also on the temporal scale of exposure and the species acclimation capacity. Warming events of a few days or weeks of duration will mainly impact at the intragenerational level, while longer-term warming will reflect on multigenerational responses.

Multigenerational rearing at the tested temperatures resulted in a further reduction of the copepod response to temperature and the apparent loss of thermal effects, implying further adaptive compensation processes.

In the warm-reared copepods, the upper tolerance to acute exposure (24h) increased by 1-1.3ºC, although this enhancement was reduced to 0.3-0.8ºC after longer thermal stress (7d). Despite the high mortality at temperatures above 30ºC, the reproductive activity was sustained across the thermal range at both control and warm-reared conditions. No shift was observed in the thermal optimum and the critical thermal maximum of the egg production response; yet, the rates in the upper thermal range were up to 21.1-fold higher for the warm-reared animals.

As a countermeasure preventing further desiccation, a 12-km long dam was constructed isolating the northern part of the Aral Sea from the rest. The “restarted” North Aral had been restored within several years from a “dying” ecosystem to a highly productive large lake. The effort led to stabilization of the North Aral volume, and was widely recognized as a success in large-scale lake restoration. As a side effect of restoration measures, part of the freshened waters overflowed into remaining semi-isolated lakes, causing them to become meromictic and creating extreme environments with strong vertical gradients of salinity, light and temperature. The deep layers of these lakes quickly developed to anaerobic environments dominated by methanogenic and sulfate-reducing microorganisms benefiting from a large amount of organic matter. By using outputs of field observations and modeling results we demonstrate the decisive role played by the mixing conditions in ecosystem adaptation to external drivers. While the North Aral Sea is restored to the well-mixed state similar to that before its desiccation started, its seasonal mixing regime is currently in unstable equilibrium, wobbling between polymictic and dimictic conditions. The fragility of this seasonal pattern is demonstrated by modeling results: slight changes of the water level or transparency may turn the Aral Sea to steadily dimictic or polymictic state.&nbsp;&nbsp;",5,861,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Over the coming century, salinity levels in Great Plains lakes are expected to rise due to climate change. Recent studies suggest that increased salinity could have negative impacts on the diversity and abundance of zooplankton in prairie lakes, but few studies have examined salinity tolerances of species common to this region. The objectives of this study are to: 1) Determine the salinity tolerance of common zooplankton species from the Great Plains; 2) Test for differences in tolerances of zooplankton in lakes with differing salinity levels; and 3) To compare salinity tolerances of zooplankton from Ontario lakes to those from the plains. Data collected for these three objectives will allow us to evaluate if common zooplankton species might be able to adapt to changing salinity levels, and if zooplankton from a region with a history of fluctuating salinity are more robust to changing salinities. To obtain zooplankton for experiments, we sampled 11 lakes in Saskatchewan and 9 in Ontario. Zooplankton were sorted into monospecific cultures and are currently being tested for salinity tolerance (EC50) in 48-h acute toxicity tests.

Besides the flow and dynamics of species, we can also seek to understand the flow of energy and materials in ecosystems, which are supported by those organisms. Resilience can come externally through inorganic transfers, migration, or gene flow that maintains local ecosystem properties. Internal resilience can emerge through local species interactions or the plasticity and adaptation of local populations. Both internal and external forms of resilience interact in parallel, if not equal, ways.

We also describe how mussels living higher on the shore and at sites exposed to direct sun tend to exhibit decreased cover of periostracum, suggesting accumulated damage from heat and desiccation at low tide could influence the accompanying ability of mussels to cope with pH stress when immersed. Finally, given periostracum is not living tissue and can be eroded over time, for example by sediment scour, we explore how abrasive removal of the periostracum by sands of differing coarseness affects shell loss, documenting a positive relationship between sand grain size and dissolution rate.

Nowadays, competition between the recent newcomer, the quagga mussel (QM), and the zebra mussel (ZM), introduced earlier, can be followed in Lake Balaton, the largest shallow lake in Central Europe. Tracking the population dynamics of the two dreissenids in the past decade, we show the displacement of the ZM by the QM in the food-limited eastern basin, and their co-existence in the food-rich western basin. Chl-A, as an indicator for the mussel food algae concentration, shows a significant drop along the west-east axis of the food-rich western basin (25-4 &amp;micro;g/L) and is uniformly low (2-4 &amp;micro;g/L) in the food-limited eastern basin. Chl-A concentration correlates with carbohydrate and protein content, and with the expression of genes involved in stress response in the QM, whereas inversely relates to lipids, however, only in the western basin. In the food-rich basin, the ZM do not differ from the QM in weight, protein and carbohydrate contents, but have higher lipid content and stress gene expression. After transplantation of mussels from the food-rich to the food-limited basin, the ZM stops growing, and its macromolecular content becomes lower, whereas, despite decreased protein and carbohydrate content, the QM increases its length and lipid content. Results suggest that the QM can better adapt to food limitation than the ZM, likely due to the ability to replace missing storage carbohydrates with accumulated lipids.

We investigated size, density, and substratum specificity of dreissenids on different living (U shells) and non-living (stones) substrata, using long-term field datasets of Lake Balaton, Hungary, from the beginning of QM invasion. We carried out lab experiment focusing on the re-colonization and post-settlement movement behavior of dreissenids regarding their substrate preferences. ZM occupies hard objects, especially stones, more often than QM. In contrast, QM more often selects U shells, but also detaches from buried substratum more often than ZM. In the field, ZM was more frequent, its density was higher and its population was more stable than that of QM. Infestation intensity of U in the field by ZM was overall higher than by QM despite the decline of the former. The observed field differences are not considered as recruitment preferences, it rather can be explained by the detachment of QM from substrate. The long term field survey also confirmed that U population may provide shelter for ZM against QM invasion. The pressure on native host species can be lower in those habitats where only QM appears and can be expected to decrease in habitats where the previously introduced ZM has been displaced by the new invader.",3,858,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

In the 1950-1980s, Lake Constance experienced a phase of severe eutrophication, resulting in significantly increased nutrient-levels. Although the natural trophic state of the lake has been restored, there have been irreversible changes to the communities of aquatic organisms. In addition to eutrophication, climate change and especially the invasion of non-native plant and animal species are endangering natural biodiversity. This leads to changes in the food webs and affect ecosystem functioning in Lake Constance. Specifically the three-spined stickleback (<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em>) and Quagga mussel (<em>Dreissena bugensis</em>) cause major problems. The stickleback and Quagga mussel populations have exploded in the last years, with sticklebacks becoming the most abundant pelagic fish species. Quagga is able to settle in all water-depths, which causes problems with water intake pipes and other structures. Furthermore, Quaggas are an important competitor for zooplankton feeding on phytoplankton.

Our large scale (30 hectares) experiment in subtropical Lake Yanglan showed that removal of benthivorous/planktivorous fish and flocculation by polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and lanthanum modified bentonite (Phoslock®) resulted in an immediate increase in water transparency (secchi depth up to 2 m) and decrease in total phosphorus (TP) (down to 50 µg/L), creating conditions for macrophyte growth. Follow-up transplanting of submerged macrophytes re-established a clear-water state in this urban lake. Although the restoration led to occurrence of large sized cladoceran Daphnia sp., but they disappeared in early summer which likely due to the recovery of young-of-the year fish in the restored area.

Shifts in the trophic state of lakes is a common change that has been shown to result in major changes in the structure of the phytoplankton community. While some species become rare or disappear with environmental changes, other species may persist at similar frequencies and abundances regardless of environmental conditions. We hypothesize that the persistence of some species is the result of evolutionary adaptation to the different environmental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we resurrected and isolated several clonal lineages of the chlorophyte <em>Chlamydomonas sp.</em> from Lake Constance sediments and characterized their competitive and defensive traits and the traits’ contribution to fitness. The lineages were isolated from the eutrophic and re-oligotrophic periods of Lake Constance, and we, therefore, estimated fitness under environmental conditions that were relevant during the different trophic periods of the lake. Specifically, we estimated fitness under low and high phosphate conditions and in the presence and absence of predation by the rotifer <em>Brachionus calyciflorus</em>. We found significant differences in the defense trait between periods and in fitness between test conditions. The differences in heritable trait variation and fitness suggests that adaptive evolution played a role in the persistence of <em>Chlamydomonas sp.</em> during the change in the trophic state of Lake Constance.",4,,6/7/23 17:00,6/7/23 18:30,Sala Portixol 2,

Most work on adaptive evolution in response to global change and on eco-evolutionary dynamics, however, focuses on the implications of evolution of single species, often in highly simplified settings. We asked the question what happens if one lets multiple species evolve simultaneously, and developed an experiment testing for eco-evolutionary dynamics in a setting where different cladoceran zooplankton species were first exposed to a selection pressure (heat wave, predation) and were then brought together in a community assembly experiment to assess their relative performance under in the environment they were selected for. The results are far from straightforward. Our results show that selection history strongly impacted community composition, implying the importance of eco-evolutionary feedback.

The degree of the contribution depends on the availability of terrestrial organic carbon in lake organic pool and the transfer efficiency of the carbon. Terrestrial organic carbon is poor-quality food for zooplankton with a mismatch of nutrition content and was incorporated to zooplankton with much lower efficiency than phytoplankton. Contributions of terrestrial carbon to zooplankton generally decrease with an increase in phytoplankton production indicating a preferential incorporation of phytoplankton in previous investigations. However, in eutrophic lakes, the dominating cyanobacteria were of poor-quality and incorporated to consumers inefficiently too. In that case, zooplankton in eutrophic wetlands, where cyanobacteria dominate the phytoplankton production and massive terrestrial plants are inundated, may not preferentially incorporate poor food-quality phytoplankton resource to their biomass. Therefore, we hypothesize that carbon contributions of terrestrial vegetation to zooplankton and to lake particulate organic pool should be similar in in such aquatic ecosystems. We tested this hypothesis by sampling zooplankton and carbon sources in Ming Lake (Jinan University campus, southern China) which was overgrown by terrestrial plants after drying and re-flooded. After 60 days of observations at weekly (or biweekly) intervals, applying stable carbon (<sup>13</sup>C), nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N) and hydrogen (<sup>2</sup>H) isotopic analysis and a stable isotope mixing model, we estimated the occurrence of extensive carbon contribution (≥50%) of flooded terrestrial plants to cladocerans and copepods. Contribution of inundated terrestrial plants to cladocerans was similar to that to lake particulate organic pool. Thus, our study quantified the role of terrestrial carbon in eutrophic wetlands, enhancing our understanding of cross-ecosystem interactions in food webs with an emphasis on the resource quality.",6,869,6/7/23 18:30,6/7/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

Short-term acute heat stress assays have now emerged to increase the comparability of global bleaching experiments. Here we used the Coral Bleaching Automated Stress System (CBASS) to compare acute heat stress responses among 4 coral reef foundation species across the Caribbean Region. About 13 coral genets were exposed to control conditions, corresponding to the reef site's Maximum Monthly Mean (MMM) Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Treated corals (replicates of the same genets) were exposed to heat loads of MMM+4ºC, MMM+6ºC, and MMM+9ºC. We tracked chlorophyll a&nbsp;fluorescence over time points to record the kinetics of the thermal response. These allowed us to estimate descriptors of photodamage and repair of PSII in algal symbionts in hospite. We measured in vivo light absorption to estimate the fraction of the photosynthetically utilizable radiation (PUR) absorbed by the coral tissue and to identify pigments that may be involved in photoprotection. As expected, the value of fluorescence signal decreased proportionally to the increase in temperature, but the absolute values differed among species and localities. Siderastrea siderea and Acropora palmata had effective photoprotective mechanisms that allowed them to resist stress as temperature increased. Although they repaired 90% of damaged PSII, their tissue pigmentation decreased more than other species. Orbicella faveolata repaired only 50% of damaged PSII’s, but the loss of pigmentation was less. This means that having more resources, O. faveolata may recover faster once thermal stress has ceased.

Understanding and quantifying intra-specific variation is important for setting protective regulations and predicting the adaptive potential of communities in the face of environmental change. Freshwater ecosystems are experiencing increasing salinization associated with mining and agriculture activities, drought, and the heavy use of de-icing salts in winter. We used two approaches to examine intraspecific variation in salt sensitivity across regions. The first was a coordinated mesocosm experiment conducted at 16 sites in Canada, USA, and Europe, where we manipulated salinity using NaCl along a nominal gradient ranging from &lt;20 to 1500 mgCl-/L and examined zooplankton abundances after 6 weeks of exposure. In these experiments, variation could be attributed to any combination of environmental and genetic effects. For the second approach we conducted 48hr acute toxicity tests on&nbsp;<em>Daphnia pulicaria</em>, a common species in lakes, to quantify variation that could be only attributed to genetic differences among individuals. In both studies, we found high intra-specific variation in salt tolerance. In our mesocosm study where the role of genetic variation was unknown, intra-specific variation was partially explained by local community composition. Across our acute toxicity tests, we found that genetic variation in salt tolerance was not&nbsp;explained by local salinity with <em>Daphnia</em>. This is in contrast to an experimental evolution study that we conducted where we found that <em>Daphnia pulicaria</em> from high salt treatments had higher tolerance to salinity than those from low salt treatments, when tested in the lab. Trade-offs associated with evolved tolerance and exposure to additional stressors&nbsp;may preclude strong relationships between salinity and tolerance in natural systems.

Managing these stressors requires their quantification, which can be time consuming and costly. Trait-based ecology studies of terrestrial ecosystems show that environmental conditions shape plant community traits, suggesting that community traits could be used as indicators of anthropogenic stressors in coral reef ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, we compared algal community traits to nutrients, sedimentation, and herbivory stress on 5 fringing reefs on Moorea, French Polynesia. Quantifying the relative strength of these stressors using bioassays showed significant variation across sites, with certain sites being ‘hot spots’ for nutrients and sedimentation stress. PCA analysis of algal community traits, comprised of 7 individual traits measured from 20-25 random algae collected at each site, showed important differences in trait space across sites. Loading plots showed that algal community traits shifted in response to variation in local stressors that would likely aid in tolerance to that stressor. For example, algae at the site with high levels of sedimentation maximized surface area relative to dry weight, while algae at another maximized height relative to dry weight, both traits likely aiding in acquisition of light.

Because ocean acidification slows coral reef growth and enhances erosion and dissolution, this study investigates local and global drivers of acidification at the FGBNMS, which occur in a region with enhanced acidification rates relative to the open ocean.

One of the well-supported theories behind is enhancement of mass transfer by water current. High flow causes a thinning of the momentum boundary layer as well as the diffusive boundary layer that facilitates gas flux between the coral and the environment, thus efflux of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) from coral tissues increases. However, no study has directly measured ROS in the boundary layer under the water current. I have measured concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, a common ROS, within a few mm above the coral surface under heat stress in a laboratory flume. As expected, under high temperature condition, concentrations of hydrogen peroxide over the corals and bleaching severity in a high-flow condition were lower than those in a low flow. The result supports the theory that the mass transfer of ROS controls degrees of coral bleaching. Also, there was interspecific variability: &lt;em&gt;Acropora tenuis&lt;/em&gt; bleached more harshly than &lt;em&gt;Galaxea fascicularis&lt;/em&gt; which produced less hydrogen peroxide and may be more heat tolerant. Moreover, it is known that cold temperature can also cause bleaching. Coral bleaching was tested under cold temperature in a similar experimental setup.

Moreover, although the performance of the two heat-sensitive species, <em>B. minutum</em> and<em> S. microadriaticum</em>, can significantly decrease under the conditions of extreme high light for short term heat treatment at 34℃, the performance recovered only for high Fe treatment (1000 pM) after switching back to normal light condition at 26℃.

Due to its critical status and ecological importance, many restoration efforts focus on its population recovery. Outplanting nursery-reared corals is a strategy to restore populations, but there is an urgent need to measure variations in demographic performance between small-scale spatial variations, in order to enhance&nbsp;site selection for restoration activities. Many restoration efforts evaluate coral demography between time and inter-sites, but less is known about the implications of intra-site spatial variation. In this study, nursery-reared fragments of <em>A. cervicornis</em> were outplanted to the reef substrate to assess demographic performance in small-scale spatial variations. We measured survival, growth, productivity, branch production, size, height, and coral cover for a period of 2 years. At the end of the study, 85% of the corals survived. <em>A. cervicornis </em>outplants showed mean growth rates intra-site variations ranging from 40.3 ± 44.6 (± SD) cm/year to&nbsp; 10.5 ± 17.0 (± SD) cm/year. Mean productivity rates ranged from 1.76 ± 1.89 (± SD) cm/year to 0.71 ± 0.95 (± SD) cm/year. Coral growth decreased during the second year post-outplanting, with 59.5 % of outplants showing negative growth. Such a reduction could be associated with predation by the fireworm <em>Hermodice carunculata</em>. Despite this negative effect, there has been a significant shift in coral size and height of the restored populations towards large colonies. After two years of restoration activities, mean colony size and height increased by 58.1% and 27.4% respectively. However, coral cover dropped by 2.9%. We conclude that <em>A. cervicornis</em> demographic success differs significantly between time and intra-site spatial variations.",0,,6/9/23 15:00,6/9/23 16:30,Sala Menorca A,

Being partly sheltered from global warming, they could fare better than shallower coral reefs in the next decades and help repopulate them through larval exchanges. The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) are home to some of World’s richest and best documented MCEs. However, these islands are highly threatened by the spread of the stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD). The transmission of the SCTLD is likely to be supported by the dispersal of fine sediments transported by the same ocean currents responsible for larval exchanges. As connectivity can be a double-edged sword, it is therefore particularly challenging to identify which reefs are best suited to protection/restoration efforts. Here, we aim to assess the contribution of USVI MCEs to the resilience of the entire coral ecosystem. More specifically, we simulate the dispersal of larvae and disease agents thanks to a Lagrangian transport model coupled with a three- dimensional unstructured-mesh hydrodynamic model to deal with the USVI’s deep and steep bathymetry. We then identify the best larvae exporters and weakest disease importers in the connectivity networks by deriving conservation metrics based on graph theory algorithms. We consider different species with various susceptibilities to SCTLD and various larval traits in order to account for the USVI’s coral diversity. This allows us to highlight the MCEs with the most positive impact on the entire coral ecosystem and that should therefore be protected/restored in priority. In addition, we give a quantitative estimate of MCEs’ contribution to shallow larval recruitment and inform on the potential of the SCTLD to reach mesophotic reefs and spread among them.",2,876,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

The resiliency of herbivore fish functions is often attributed to high levels of trophic redundancy between species. This is especially true for browsing herbivorous fishes, well-known for their role in removing macroalgae. However, most of these findings are based on algal transplant assays, confounding natural estimates of resource use and redundancy. Here, we combine stomach contents and stable isotope analyses to yield insight into natural browsing fish trophic redundancy. We collected browsers from offshore reefs largely devoid of macroalgae and nearshore reefs with seasonally dynamic macroalgae habitats to understand how resource availability drives trophic redundancy through both space and time. We documented not only surprising omnivory, but that trophic redundancy of browsers is habitat dependent. Higher levels of trophic redundancy existed on nearshore reefs with more abundant macroalgae, with greater complementarity on offshore reefs. These findings were consistent between methods, highlighting temporal stability in trophic partitioning among browsers. We also documented yet undescribed species-specific variation in trophic ecology between reefs, highlighting flexibility in trophic ecology. These findings underscore dynamic variability in the delivery of key herbivore functions to reef resiliency across habitats, and highlight greater susceptibility of browsing herbivory to anthropogenic disturbances on reefs with low algae cover.",4,,6/9/23 17:00,6/9/23 18:30,Sala Menorca A,

Galápagos corals experience a wide range of temperatures and inhabit marginal conditions compared to other tropical reefs. The stress tolerance of corals remaining after recent warm- and cold-water bleaching events in the archipelago may be the product of adaptation and acclimatization. In the spring of 2019, we investigated thermal tolerance differences in <em>Pocillopora</em> sp., a widespread reef-building coral in the Indo-Pacific found throughout the Galápagos. We unexpectedly found that corals from northern sites–which experience warmer and less variable annual average temperatures–were more resilient than those from central and southern sites, having both greater heat and cold tolerances. In this study, we sequenced the mitochondrial open reading frame (ORF) to determine <em>Pocillopora</em> haplotype, amplified actin using quantitative PCR to determine symbiont type, and used RNAseq to explore gene expression patterns in our samples. We aim to understand how these variables correlate with heat and cold tolerance. Preliminary results suggest that the thermally-tolerant symbiont <em>Durisdinium</em> is absent from most central and southern sites and a thermally tolerant <em>Pocillopora</em> ORF haplotype (type 1) exists in far northern and most central southeastern communities, possibly explaining differences in thermal tolerance across regions.

Marine ecosystems have been particularly impacted by climate change, with many being on the brink of collapse. This is the case for Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages, a complex and highly diverse marine ecosystem that has suffered dramatic declines over the past decade due to rising temperatures. To halt the impacts of climate change the international efforts to reduce carbon emissions have never been so ambitious. However, even in the most optimistic CO<sub>2</sub> emission scenarios, the planet will continue to warm and experience the effects of climate change over the coming decades. For this reason, understanding the resilience of these key habitats to warmer temperatures is crucial to predict their viability under future climatic conditions. Here, we will present our work exploring the resilience of Mediterranean coralligenous populations from a long-term marine protected area. More specifically, we use demographic data for the key coralligenous species <em>Paramuricea clavata</em> to quantify its capacity to resist and recover from future disturbances, comparing contemporary data against populations from the early 2000s. Overall, our results show that the demographic resilience of <em>P. clavata</em> populations has decreased dramatically, through a sharp drop in their resistance to disturbances. These findings confirm that future climatic conditions will make these populations even more vulnerable to further perturbations, highlighting the importance of limiting the impacts of other threats to them.",5,,6/9/23 15:00,6/9/23 16:30,Sala Menorca A,

The effects of sedimentation on the survival and recovery potential of the corals <em>Montipora capitata</em>, <em>Porites lobata,</em> and <em>Pocillopora meandrina</em> were assessed to understand the potential impacts of the dredging of Honolulu Harbor on nearby coral reefs. Corals were exposed to either fine sediment or coarse sediment through five pulses during two 18-day experiments. Treatments ranged from a control (0 mg<sup> </sup>cm<sup>-2</sup>) to a high sediment level (60 mg<sup> </sup>cm<sup>-2</sup>). Measurements of survival, growth, tissue cover and physiological condition of the corals including pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry were conducted.

These interactions are mediated by excreted small compounds – infochemicals – which can impact microbial physiology and community structure. This work aims to reveal the biomolecular mechanism of one such interaction, in which the bacterial quorum sensing molecule 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ) produced by the marine bacterium <em>Pseudoalteromonas sp. </em>arrests cell division and confers protection against virus-induced mortality in the globally abundant phytoplankton <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em>. Here, we investigate whether HHQ inhibits an enzyme critical for nucleotide biosynthesis – dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) – in <em>E. huxleyi</em>, which may explain many of the physiological and metabolic changes induced in <em>E. huxleyi</em> by HHQ. Preliminary evidence supports inhibition of <em>E. huxleyi</em> DHODH (EhDHODH) by HHQ, with 10 uM HHQ being sufficient to significantly reduce endogenous DHODH activity in <em>E. huxleyi</em> cell lysate. The specifics of HHQ's impact on EhDHODH will be further quantified by precisely assaying activity of pure, recombinant EhDHODH exposed to HHQ, yielding an IC50 and a kinetic profile of the inhibited enzyme.

In aquatic environments, DMS plays an important role as an infochemical mediating diverse trophic interactions. Yet, its role in microbial predator-prey interactions remains elusive with contradicting evidence for its role in either algal chemical defense or in the chemoattraction of grazers to prey cells. Here, we investigated the signaling role of DMS during zooplankton-algae interactions by genetic and biochemical manipulation of the algal DMS-generating enzyme dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase (DL) in a coccolithophorid alga. We inhibited DL activity in prey cells using the selective DL-inhibitor 2-bromo-3-(dimethylsulfonio)-propionate (Br-DMSP), or overexpressed the DL-encoding gene in a model diatom. We found that algal DL activity did not serve as an anti-grazing chemical defense, but paradoxically enhanced predation by diverse micro- and mesozooplankton, including dinoflagellates, ciliates and copepods. The role of algal DMS revealed here, acting as an eat-me signal for grazers, raises fundamental questions regarding the retention of its biosynthetic enzyme through the evolution of dominant bloom-forming phytoplankton in the ocean. To address this, we identified DL homologs across eukaryotic lineages and investigated their taxonomy and biogeography, with the aim of establishing new ecologically-relevant model systems to study the unknown cellular roles of the DL enzyme.",4,,6/9/23 15:00,6/9/23 16:30,Sala Ibiza A,

These blooms have become more widespread, and have appeared in all of the NY State Finger Lakes Region in the last 10 years, including oligotrophic Skaneateles Lake. Wet and dry atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs in the eastern USA have increasingly been dominated by reduced forms of nitrogen. Wet atmospheric deposition of NH4+ is well documented, but dry deposition of gaseous NH3 is less well characterized. To better understand the importance of landscape and direct surface NH3 deposition to Skaneateles Lake, we continuously monitored atmospheric NH3 concentrations from May 2021 to June 2022 using passive samplers with 2-week exposure times, and the protocols of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program, Ammonia Monitoring Network (NADP/AMoN). We have estimated deposition of NH3 into the terrestrial watershed using two different modeling approaches, TDep/EQUATES and STAGE, and onto the lake surface which is equal to 23% of the watershed area.&nbsp; We estimate that dry fluxes of NH3 represent 60% to 65% of the dry N deposition, and 20% to 30% of the total (wet + dry) N deposition. NH3 direct deposition to the lake surface accounts for an estimated 4% of the total N loading input to the lake, with an additional NH3 loading of 8% from the terrestrial watershed. If precipitation NH4+ is included, 29% of the total N load to the lake is from reduced forms of N (NH3 + NH4+).

Recent studies suggest a protective role of MCs against H2O2 damage. This gives the toxigenic strain an advantage in the presence of sufficient nitrogen (needed to produce MC), whereas at other times the non-toxigenic strain, which uses the alternative strategy of degrading H2O2, is favored. A model based on this mechanism can reproduce the observed toxigenic fraction succession and MC concentration in Lake Erie (Hellweger et al. 2022, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm6791).&nbsp; An open question is if this mechanism can also explain strain-level ecology and toxin concentrations in other systems. We investigated the role of this mechanism by applying the model to nine different cases (i.e. different lakes, stations, times). The model was able to reproduce the observed field data (MCs and toxic fraction, biomass, nutrients and if available H2O2) for all cases, which constitutes support for the proposed mechanism. To explore lake management, we simulated single and dual nutrient reduction (i.e. nitrogen and/or phosphorous). These results suggest, as was also predicted for Lake Erie, that a reduction of P alone may not reduce the toxin concentrations and even increase it. A P-only reduction results in higher N availability and therefore MC production, also affecting toxigenic fraction. However, this will only occur for cases where N is presently limiting at some point.",1,,6/8/23 15:00,6/8/23 16:30,Sala Palma,

The hydrodynamic model is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The biogeochemical model simulates key biogeochemical processes including both N and P cycles, phytoplankton growth, and microbial loop. A three-dimensional simulation was carried out for 2018-2020 and calibrated with available data. This presentation focuses on the dynamic interactions between physical processes (winds, currents, vertical mixing) and diel vertical migration (DVM) of <em>M. aeruginosa</em> during summertime. Model results indicate that the lake exhibits a two-layer circulation structure with surface and bottom currents generally moving in the opposite directions. In the morning, upward migration of <em>M. aeruginosa</em> allows cells to alleviate light-limitation and grow rapidly. At the same time, prevailing southerly winds move the cells northeastward. In the afternoon, <em>M. aeruginosa</em> sink to the bottom, where prevailing currents move the cells toward the western lake. At night, strong vertical mixing re-distributes the cells vertically. As a result, summer cyanobacteria blooms are largely concentrated in the central and northwestern lake. These results are overall consistent with limited <em>in situ</em> phytoplankton profiles, and the cyanobacteria index obtained from remote sensing images and daily optical observations by a SeaPrism.

Chl <em>a</em> also decreased with an increase in clam biomass in the high fish treatments. Moreover, filter-feeding fish resulted in a decrease in algal sizes (e.g., the colony size of <em>Microcystis aeruginosa</em> was inversely related to fish biomass) which likely increased the filter-feeding efficiency of bivalves. Biomass of filter-feeding fish was found to be a key factor driving the synergistic effects of filter-feeding fish and bivalves in waters dominated by <em>Microcystis</em> colonies. Long-term monitoring revealed increasing trends in Chl <em>a</em> concentrations, total fish catch per unit effort (TF-CPUE), and filter-feeding fish (FF-CPUE), and slightly decreasing trends in bivalve biomass and nitrogen to phosphorus ratios (N:P) between 2006 to 2016.

CyanoSeq is assembled from 16S rRNA sequences found within NCBI, with their taxonomies curated from cyanobacterial taxonomic literature as well as a systematic assessment of uncharacterized cyanobacterial sequences. In addition to curated cyanobacterial sequences, CyanoSeq is composed of plastid, bacterial, and Melainabacteria sequences for more robust phylogenetic interpretations.",0,895,6/8/23 18:30,6/8/23 20:00,Mezzanine,

There are complicating factors of various origin (biological and physical) working across time scales (sub-daily to seasonal) and length scales (micrometers to meters). To elucidate the drivers of <em>Microcystis </em>vertical distributions, research has been conducted in three parts: (i) an exploratory field study of <em>Microcystis</em> vertical distributions, (ii) a theoretical model explaining previous observations, and (iii) a targeted field study to calibrate theoretical model parameters. The exploratory field study utilized a long-duration, high-frequency research station in a stratified and eutrophic lake. Using a combination of dimensional analyses and machine learning techniques, results indicated that subsurface <em>Microcystis</em> concentration peak magnitude and location were significantly mediated by lake thermal structure. A novel theoretical model to explain these observations was subsequently derived, coupling lake hydrodynamics with <em>Microcystis</em> motility and colony dynamics in a one-dimensional advection-dispersion-aggregation model. Results demonstrated vertical transport is highly dependent on <em>Microcystis</em> colony size, which is in turn dependent on wind-induced mixing.

Due to the difficulty of mapping seagrass density and MPB distribution on unvegetated flats, estimating benthic productivity is technically challenging at scale. Based on Sentinel-2 data, our study established a new machine learning (ML) model to detect the distribution of seagrass (<em>Zostera muelleri</em>) and unvegetated flats. Then using published photosynthesis-irradiance curves established for emerged and submerge periods we estimated estuary wide gross primary productivity. The ML model included supervised classification with random forest to delineate seagrass and unvegetated area and three machine learning regressions (artificial neural network, support vector machine and random forest regression) to predict the seagrass density. The result of supervised classification using random forest yielded an impressive accuracy (0.96) while ANN also showed a precise prediction of seagrass density. Results indicated that seagrass currently dominants productivity particularly in warmer seasons because coverage is high, and it maintains production during emergence. However, with sea level rise, MPB production is likely to dominate provided the water remains clear. Our modelling suggests negative impacts on productivity when sea level rise is coupled with increased turbidity emphasizing the need to control sediment loading to coastal waters to maintain current productivity.",1,,6/6/23 17:00,6/6/23 18:30,Sala Menorca A,
